### Writing Style

* Keep articles to 2-3 paragraphs unless you're writing a tutorial
* You can use American or British English
* Headings: do not capitalise short prepositions or conjunctions, unless they have more than four letters ("Then")
* Sub-headings: title case, but feel free to use sentence case if it suits the content
* If a term is not obvious (not all readers will be experts), provide a link to a resource explaining it*

### Images

* Remove shadows from Mac OS windows -- this will do it after killing SystemUIServer: <code>defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true</code>
* Larger images like screenshots that appear in the post body should be 500 pixels wide (for consistency)

### Site Generation

Install using `npm install pop`.  Generate with `pop`.
