###vim-showspaces

If you've got a colleague who just can't stop messing up whitespace, then you may want to politely suggest (or surreptitiously install) Laurent Georget's [ShowSpaces](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5148) (GitHub: [guiniol/vim-showspaces](https://github.com/guiniol/vim-showspaces)) plugin.

It's a small albeit focused plugin that shows whitespace at the beginning of lines.  You can change the highlight colour and turn it off -- the full details are in the readme and bundled documentation.

###ColumnTags.vim

[ColumnTags](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5135) (GitHub: [kbairak/ColumnTags.vim](https://github.com/kbairak/ColumnTags.vim)) by Konstantinos Bairaktaris is a plugin that uses ctags with split windows to allow you to navigate code.

Pressing `CTRL-]` will follow a tag and open it in a new column.  You can keep doing this to navigate further down, so you end up with stacked columns.  You can press `CTRL-t` to go back or `CTRL-,` to shift all columns to the right.
