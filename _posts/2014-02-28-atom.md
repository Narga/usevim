![Atom](/images/posts/atom.png)

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a desktop text editor that supports [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and is based on web technology.

Yes, [there's a Vim mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode).  I haven't yet had a chance to try it out, but I've requested a beta invite.  Incidentally, a beta invitation for an open source text editor seems weird to me.
