[WinMan](http://sennah911.github.io/WinMan/) now has a website and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sennah911/WinMan).  The repository doesn't have any source code -- the author isn't sure if it will be open source yet.

> WinMan is a "window manager" for OS X that handles windows, apps and other things using Vim-like expressions. If you are used to and love Vim, then this is the ultimate tool to get rid of the mouse even outside of your text editor.

I previously wrote about WinMan last month in [A Vim-inspired Mac Window Manager](http://usevim.com/2014/07/30/window-manager/).  Back then it was just an interesting video, but it's received some attention from reddit and the author continues to make progress videos.

It has a JavaScript API, so even if it isn't eventually open source it should be relatively hackable.
