Well-known Vim plugin author Tim Pope is currently hosting an AMA on reddit: [I am Tim Pope, crafter of plugins. AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/267vrv/i_am_tim_pope_crafter_of_plugins_ama/)

One of the interesting questions that I randomly pulled out was about his favourite programming language:

> `[–]art_l_vandelay` 19 points 20 hours ago
>
> What's your favorite programming language, and the project you are most proud of that you built with it?

To which he replied:

> `[–]tpope[S]` 21 points 19 hours ago
>
> I'm just enough of a polyglot to not have a favorite. My current front runners would be Ruby and Clojure, and I hate each for not being the other.
>
> As far as pride goes, you'd have to go pretty far down the list before finding something that isn't VimL. I'm not even sure what it would be.
