[Vimusical](http://www.moo-mou.com/vimusical) (GitHub: [moo-mou / vimusical](https://github.com/moo-mou/vimusical)) by "moo-mou" is a Python script that allows you to generate sound based on keystrokes in Vim.

The Python program uses [a configuration file](https://github.com/moo-mou/vimusical/blob/master/config.json) so you can change the sound it makes.  The project is currently lacking documentation, so it'll take a bit of digging to get it working.

You could probably use a similar approach to hook Vim up to something like [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) or [PD](http://puredata.info/).
