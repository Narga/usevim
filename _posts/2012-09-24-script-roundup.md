###Fanf,ingTastic;

[Fanf,ingTastic;](https://github.com/dahu/vim-fanfingtastic) (License: _Vim_) by Barry Arthur provides several ways to enhance `Ff,Tt` and `;`.  Once installed, the default settings allow the supported motion commands to wrap lines, and there are additional options for ignoring case and aliasing keys:

* `'fanfingtastic_all_inclusive'`: Makes backward movements `inclusive`
* `'fanfingtastic_fix_t'`: Fixes the behavior of `tT,;`
* `'fanfingtastic_ignorecase'`: Provides case insensitive `fFtT;`
* `'fanfingtastic_use_jumplist'`Adds the movementsments of `fFtT;` to the `jumplist`

###Taboo

[Taboo](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4237) (GitHub: [gcmt / taboo.vim](https://github.com/gcmt/taboo.vim), License: _MIT_) by Giacomo Comitti is a small tab management plugin.  It provides easy shortcuts for renaming tabs, and opening tabs with a prompt for the tab name.  The naming scheme for unnamed tabs can also be changed by setting `g:taboo_format`.
