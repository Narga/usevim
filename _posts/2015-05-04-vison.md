[Vison](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5162) (GitHub: [Quramy/vison](https://github.com/Quramy/vison)) by Yosuke Kurami is a plugin for writing JSON schema files.  It handles completion for keys and values, and works with [downloadable JSON schemas](http://schemastore.org/json/) that are intended to be used for auto-completion.

The completion menu includes type hints and shows what values are optional, so it will make writing JSON files much easier.  This is ideal if you frequently write things like package.json files.
