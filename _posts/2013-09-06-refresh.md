When collaborating with Git, I find the `git fetch`, `git rebase` pattern suits me.  I like the cleaner history.   Sometimes I'll switch to `cherry-pick` for applying specific changes for safe deployments.

I used to get into a mess with Vim when using this workflow, because I typically have a lot of open files spread across tabs and windows, so Vim would complain about changes to active buffers.  You're probably familiar with this error:

{% highlight text %}
WARNING: The file has been changed since reading it!!!
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes the file isn't even different in terms of content, it's just that Git has moved things around on the filesystem.  The solution is simple: reopen the file with `:e filename`.  However, doing that for every file is too much work -- it'd be easier to restart Vim.

That's where `:bufdo` comes in.  Running `:bufdo e` will make Vim reopen every buffer.  That isn't necessarily the best approach because you can have a lot of open buffers that you don't really care about.  If that's true, try `:windo e` -- this executes the command `e` in each window.

You need to be careful when running these commands.  Before running `:bufdo` or `:windo` I make sure my files are saved, then I commit my changes, then I `git fetch`, `git rebase`, then `:windo e`.
