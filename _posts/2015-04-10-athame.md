If you use readline's Vim mode, then you might be interested in [athame](https://github.com/ardagnir/athame).  This project is a patch for readline that embeds Vim, so you can use Vim's full editing capabilities rather than the more limited vi-mode subset that readline provides.

It uses the same author's [Vimbed](https://github.com/ardagnir/vimbed) project, which is used by [Pterosaur](http://github.com/ardagnir/pterosaur).  Athame works by sending keys to an instance of Vim, which means you can search history using `/` and `?`.

Because one of the advantages of Neovim is embedding, I wondered what a similar Neovim/readline fork would look like.  However, it might be possible to approach the problem differently: use a Vim script to communicate with a Neovim `:terminal`.

If you want to try out vi-mode in your terminal, try `set -o vi`, type some text, and then press escape to start navigating using Normal mode commands.
