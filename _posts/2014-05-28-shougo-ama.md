I enjoyed reading [Tim Pope's AMA on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/267vrv/i_am_tim_pope_crafter_of_plugins_ama/), and it has now been followed by a [Shougo AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/26epvf/i_am_shougo_dark_vim_master_%E6%9A%97%E9%BB%92%E7%BE%8E%E5%A4%A2%E7%8E%8B_uncock_vim_awe/).  Shougo is the author of several popular Vim plugins, including unite.vim and neocomplete.

There's a lot of discussion about Vim's popularity and usage styles in Japan, and the reasons why Shougo likes Vim and Vim script.
