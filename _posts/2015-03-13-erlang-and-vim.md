If you're an Erlang fan, how do you configure Vim? Adam Rutkowski sent me [Writing Erlang with Vim](http://aerosol.github.io/anxibits/vim-as-your-erlang-ide/), which includes his favourite plugins for tmux integration, Erlang code navigation, and documentation lookups.

> Did you know that there's a suite of vim plugins dedicated to Erlang development making it, hands down, the best Erlang/OTP development environment? Let me break it down for you.

He's included videos for each plugin so you can see how it's supposed to work.

I noticed Adam uses [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) for the videos -- this is new to me but seems amazingly useful for showing off cool terminal tricks.  It actually shows terminal screencasts as text, complete with colours, which looks a lot better than blurry gifs.
