###blockit

[blockit](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4848) (GitHub: [sk1418 / blockit](https://github.com/sk1418/blockit), License: _MIT_) by Kent Yuan allows you to wrap text in horizontal or vertical blocks.  You can specify characters to use for the vertical and horizontal replacements, so you could easily wrap a region with `-` and `|` characters to make a box.

The readme has examples with animated gifs so it's easy to see how it works.

###Enchanted Vim

[Enchanted Vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4849) by Marcin Szamotulski makes regular expressions behave as if `\v` had been used.  You might like this if you need to search with brackets a lot and find the escaping difficult, but check `:help magic` to be clear about the implications of `\v` and `\m`.
