I've seen many people confused by Vim's help system, particularly when installing a new plugin.  An IRC friend of mine had installed Tim Pope's [rails.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails), and couldn't work out why `:help rails` didn't work.  The reason for this is Vim has to be told about new help files through the `:helptags` command.

Vim itself has documentation for `:helptags` in `:help :helptags`, and the command can be abbreviated to `:helpt`.  Running it with the directory your plugin was installed to will make the help file available.

Let's say you've installed rails.vim to `~/.vim/bundle/vim-rails` because you use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), then to generate the help tags you'd have to type `:helpt ~/.vim/bundle/vim-rails/doc`.

However, realising that generating help tags is often a chore, Pathogen includes a `:Helptags` command that automatically generates help tags for every directory in `runtimepath`.  Also, [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) _automatically_ generates help tags for the plugins it manages.

If you're used to other editors, then having to run a command to make plugin help files available might seem a bit strange at first, but it's just one of those things you need to be aware of when using Vim.

As for `runtimepath`, I'll explain more about that in a future Vim 101 post.
