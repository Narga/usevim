###undotree.vim

![Undotree](/images/posts/undotree.png)

[undotree.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4177) (GitHub: [mbbill / undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree), License: _BSD_) by Ming Bai displays a visual representation of Vim's undo branches.

Once it's installed, a panel can be displayed by typing `:UndotreeToggle` that shows edits over time, and there's a diff panel which shows an overview of text changes.

###dwm.vim

I actually use a Mac a lot of the time, but whenever I find myself using another Unix I really enjoy tiled window managers like [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/).  [dwm.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4186) (GitHub: [spolu / dwm.vim](https://github.com/spolu/dwm.vim)) by Stanislas Polu is a dwm-inspired layout manager for Vim.

Using this plugin splits the screen up into a large working area with a set of smaller stacks on the right.  Creating a new window will make it use the larger space, and the previous windows will be stacked in the right-hand-side column.  This is the default tiled layout, and it's the only layout at the moment but more could be added.
