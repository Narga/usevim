![Enabling experimental rendering](/images/posts/vimexperimental.png)

If you use [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) and are lucky enough to own a MacBook Pro with a Retina display, then you [may have noticed performance issues](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/vim_mac/zLwyYdIUv_0/discussion).  Users are reporting slow scrolling and unexpected latency when entering text.

Fortunately, enabling "experimental rendering" appears to fix the problem.  This can be found in the Preferences, Advanced menu (`cmd ,`).

Bj√∂rn Winckler responded to say that he can't test this because he doesn't have a machine with a Retina display, which is understandable, but just goes to show how difficult testing a popular product can be even on Apple's hardware (given the smaller variance in hardware compared to the PC as a whole).
