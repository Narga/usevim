[ViCiOUS](http://viciousapp.com/) from 5vor9 is a commercial ($19.95) Xcode plugin that makes Xcode behave like Vim.  I've previously talked about [XVim](http://usevim.com/2012/05/23/xvim/), a Vim keybinding plugin for XCode, but ViCiOUS is more elaborate.  It supports various editing modes: Normal, Visual, and Visual Block are all supported.  The current mode is displayed in the top-right of each editing window.  Selections can be yanked into named registers, and my most frequently used motions work as well (like `f` and `t`).

Repeat works (`.`) but `@:` doesn't seem to be supported.  Macros work, and the mode display changes to read `(recording)` just like Vim.

There's a settings screen that allows yank and put to use the system clipboard, and other settings like optionally using Xcode's standard search and replace functionality.

ViCiOUS also supports automatic updates, so hopefully the authors will keep it up to date if Apple release a major update that breaks it.

As it stands, ViCiOUS offers a way to reapply your hard-won Vim skills and keyboard shortcut muscle memory to Xcode, which may be less effort than getting a console-friendly build environment going for iOS/Mac projects.
