![Vim Keyboard Shortcuts Stickers](/images/posts/vim-shortcut-stickers-530.jpg)

[These vinyl Vim stickers](http://cmd.club/collections/frontpage/products/vim-keyboard-shortcuts-stickers), available for $9.99, are transparent and show the shortcuts for window management, Normal mode, Visual mode, and search.

In the photo the sticker is shown on a laptop's hand rest area, which seems like a good place to stick them if you're trying to learn Vim.  The same company (cmd.club) also sells [some bash stickers](http://cmd.club/collections/frontpage/products/bash-keyboard-shortcuts-stickers) that are a similar style.
