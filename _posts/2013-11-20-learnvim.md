[LearnVim](https://github.com/dahu/LearnVim) by Barry Arthur is an introduction to Vim, distributed as a help text file.

> A suggested path for learning Vim.
> This help file introduces fundamental concepts, offers concrete advice for correctly configuring a new Vim instance and outlines a progressive set of topics for the enthusiastic newcomer to study and practise.

You can drop it into your `.vim/doc` directory, which allows the document to be easily searched.  It's written in a tutorial style that starts by introducing the help system, then goes on to configuring Vim, and eventually explores motions and marks.

The last section teaches you how to install and use some plugins.  Barry recommends Pathogen for installing and managing plugins.

> Created by the venerable, tpope, this plugin is a light-weight plugin manager for Vim.  It allows you to install, test, upgrade and uninstall plugins much more easily than the default Vim approach.
