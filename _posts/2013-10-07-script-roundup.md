###Accordion

[Accordion](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4735) (GitHub: [mattboehm / vim-accordion](https://github.com/mattboehm/vim-accordion), License: _Vim_) is a Vim window manager that automatically shrinks vertical split windows so you can focus on the active window.  It's by the same author as [Unstack](https://github.com/mattboehm/vim-unstack) and can be used with Unstack to show stack traces in vertically split windows.

###VerticalHelp

[VerticalHelp](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4729) by Mel Davis is a plugin that makes help open in vertical splits.  This may work better for you if you use a widescreen monitor.  It functions just like the standard help command, `:help`, and can be run by typing `:H`.
