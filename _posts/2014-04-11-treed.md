I don't know if Vim-inspired aesthetics is a thing, but some people are definitely console fetishists.  Ideas from Vim and text-based UIs make their way into web software, and a great example of this is [Treed](http://jaredly.github.io/treed/) (GitHub: [jaredly / treed](https://github.com/jaredly/treed), License: _Apache 2.0_) by Jared Forsyth.

Treed is a "tree editing" component.  By using some of Vim's keyboard shortcuts, you can navigate and edit trees, and the results can be rendered in real time using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).

It actually has Normal mode and "edit mode", so you can press escape and `i`, `a`, `A`, or even `o` and `O` to start editing -- `o` will insert a new node much like Vim.  Undo is supported as well.

Although Vim-inspired keyboard shortcuts might seem to have a niche appeal, I think depending on the context this kind of flexible UI component will appeal to power users.
