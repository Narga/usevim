###vim-autoformat

A reader sent in [vim-autoformat](https://github.com/Chiel92/vim-autoformat), which uses external programs to format code.  The default `formatprograms` include formatters for C, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python.

The reader mentioned that it's useful for Python programmers who want to format code according to [PEP 8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

###Fist of Vim

Fist of Vim (GitHub: [ajh17 / vim-fist](https://github.com/ajh17/vim-fist), License: _Vim_) by Akshay Hegde is an extremely simple Gist script.  It uses `<Leader>p` for creating new Gists, and `<Leader>u` for updating them.

You can create anonymous Gists, open them in a browser, and create secret Gists.  If you've ever wanted to treat Gists like a kind of simplified Evernote replacement from within Vim, then this might do it.
