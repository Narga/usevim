[vim-asterisk](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5059) (GitHub: [haya14busa/vim-asterisk](https://github.com/haya14busa/vim-asterisk), License: _MIT_) by haya14busa aims to improve the `*` motion.  The `*` motion itself searches forward for the word nearest the cursor, so it's quite useful once you get used to it.

However, vim-asterisk allows you to search within visual selections and it uses smartcase by default which seems more natural to me.

haya14busa notes that the visual search feature is based on [vim-visualstar](https://github.com/thinca/vim-visualstar).
