![Vim Adventures Quiz](/images/posts/adventuresquiz.png)

I just discovered a new Vim Adventures game, the [Vim Adventures Quiz](http://vim-adventures.com/quiz/).  This is a smaller challenge where you're tested on the number of keystrokes made to fix a text file.

You can type `:help` to get instructions for the game and some Vim tips, and `:q` to exit.  The `:keyboard` command allows you to press a key and get a textual description of what it would do in Vim, which is really useful.  If you get stuck you can click the icon on the bottom left to display a menu.
