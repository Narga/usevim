![Split windows](/images/posts/vim101-windows.png)

Windows are a viewport on a [buffer](http://usevim.com/2012/03/23/buffers/).  Opening Vim displays a single window, which is how most text editors generally appear.  However, the real power of Vim, and something people miss out on in a lot of editors, is multiple windows.  Windows can be split horizontally and vertically as needed, and then moved, resized, and closed.

Window commands start with `CTRL-W`, which makes it pretty easy to learn the basic commands:

* `CTRL-W s` (window split): Split the current window horizontally
* `CTRL-W v` (window vertical): Split the current window vertical
* `CTRL-W w`: Move to the next window, `CTRL-W W` will move to the previous one 
* `CTRL-W k`: Move the cursor up (`hjkl` work as expected)

To get help on window cursor movement and see all of the other commands, type `:help window-move-cursor`.

###Window Management

Windows can be closed with `CTRL-W q`, and closing the last window will exit Vim.

Windows can be vertically resized by typing `CTRL-W -` and `CTRL-W +` -- this is sometimes useful when working with a lot of windows, and the current file demands more attention than the rest.  Horizontal resizing uses `<` and `>`, which is easy to remember.  Typing `CTRL-W |` makes the current window as wide as possible, and `CTRL-W _` does the same thing for the height.

The resize commands accept a numerical argument, so typing `CTRL-W 9+` would increase the current window by 9 lines.

Sometimes windows need to be moved.  Movement uses the standard `hjkl` keys, but capitalised instead:

* `CTRL-W H`: Move the current window to the left, using the full width
* `CTRL-W J`: Move the current window to the bottom, using the full height
* `CTRL-W K`: Move the current window to the top, using the full width
* `CTRL-W L`: Move the current window to the right, using the full height

I don't often use these commands, but one related command I do use is `CTRL-W T` which opens the current window in a new tab.  This can be useful when the buffer becomes too long or complex and deserves its own tab.

###Mouse

If [Vim has been set up to use a mouse](http://usevim.com/2012/05/16/mouse/), even in text mode, then windows can be resized by clicking and dragging its status line.
