He gives some examples with Vim and [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive), detailing the exact keystrokes needed to use `:Gblame` to compare buffers against files on GitHub.

I often find myself using Git from within Vim, and I like this use of `:Gblame`.  If you haven't used Fugitive before and you're collaborating on a project, then you should definitely try installing it and typing `:Gblame` just to see the basic usage.  Like Mislav I usually find the source of the bad code was me, but the commit logs are still useful!
