###glowshi-ft.vim

glowshi-ft.vim (GitHub: [saihoooooooo / glowshi-ft.vim](https://github.com/saihoooooooo/glowshi-ft.vim)) by Shinya Saiho is a cool visualisation plugin for the `f` and `t` motions.  When a line has multiple targets, it display highlights and allows you to jump between them.

There are settings for changing the mapping behaviour, case handling, and timeout length.

###Clighter

[Clighter](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4983) (GitHub: [bbchung / clighter](https://github.com/bbchung/clighter)) by BB Chung is a semantic source highlighting plugin based on Clang.  It can do things like highlight occurrences of matching words under the cursor.  It doesn't replace the built-in C syntax handling, but instead enhances it.
