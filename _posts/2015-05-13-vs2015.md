There have been a few patches to [vim's master branch](https://github.com/vim/vim/commits/master) that ensure Vim builds in [Visual Studio 2015](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd831853\(v=vs.140\).aspx).  Visual Studio has a [free "Community" edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/free-developer-offers-vs.aspx) that was introduced last year, and one of the main reasons people are excited about the 2015 RC is Microsoft's continued efforts to support cross-platform development.

I'm not really a Windows developer, but I'd prefer to be able to build Vim in Visual Studio rather than having to install GCC for Windows.  Builds [initially failed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/lT_BBQJxr_U/vSzPNwwoIrQJ) under the 2015 RC, but it looks like the [main issue](https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/detail?id=357) was fairly minor.  If you're trying out a free RC you should at least be able to get Vim to build again now.
