![Vim: From Essentials to Mastery](/images/posts/vim-essentials-to-mastery.png)

[Vim: From Essentials to Mastery](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Vim-From-Essentials-to-Mastery) by Bill Odom is a presentation from last year's Strange Loop conference that covers Vim fundamentals, mentions Commodore Amiga, and goes right from the basics to more advanced usage.  InfoQ has presented the talk with high quality slides, which include screenshots and keyboard shortcut examples.

If you're looking for an introduction to Vim that includes practical tips and examples of the popular plugins, then this is a very easy to follow presentation.
