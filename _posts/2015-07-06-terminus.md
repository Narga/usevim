[Terminus](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5216) (GitHub: [wincent/terminus](https://github.com/wincent/terminus)) by Greg Hurrell is a plugin for improving Vim's integration with terminals, with features designed for tmux and iTerm. Features include:

* Cursor shape in Insert mode: thin vertical bar in the console
* Mouse support: Activates 'mouse' support in all modes and additionally tries to activate `sgr-mouse` support
* Terminal support for `FocusGained` and `FocusLost` events
* Paste mode, so you don't have to set the `'paste'` option

These features make Vim feel more like a GUI text editor, without doing anything too complex. I've seen quite a few plugins that attempt to improve the focus support, but I haven't yet tried using `sgr-mouse`. It seems like a good set of feature enhancements that people switching to console Vim are interested in.
