You're a green cursor that must highlight words whilst avoiding red `G` characters.  Welcome to [PacVim](https://github.com/jmoon018/PacVim), a game for learning Vim by Jamal Moon.

The readme has detailed installation instructions, which is great for beginners, and is launched by running `pacvim` rather than from within Vim itself.

To complete a level you have to highlight all the words, so it's a bit like eating the [Pac-Dots](http://pacman.wikia.com/wiki/Pac-Dots) in PacMac.  The implemented commands include `hjkl` for movement, `w` and `e` for word navigation, and `$` for moving to the end of the line.  There are many more commands which are [documented in the readme](https://github.com/jmoon018/PacVim#list-of-implemented-commands).

It's written in C++, but you can create your own levels (maps) with text files.
