Sometimes it's not clear if you should use a macro or a plugin for a common editing task.  There are things that I'll instinctively create a macro for (`:help complex-repeat`), and others that are broad enough to be made into plugins.  In those cases it's often best to search for a plugin first.

Here's one such example: Mark Volkmann's [vim-js-arrow-function](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5200) (GitHub: [mvolkmann/vim-js-arrow-function](https://github.com/mvolkmann/vim-js-arrow-function)).  It's a small plugin, but does something broad enough that is safely tucked away in a plugin -- it turns anonymous JavaScript functions into their "fat arrow" equivalents.

In JavaScript you commonly pass anonymous functions to methods, like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var a = [
  'Hydrogen',
  'Helium',
  'Lithium',
  'BerylÂ­lium'
];

var a2 = a.map(function(s) { return s.length });
{% endhighlight %}

But JavaScript is evolving and now (kind of, you'll generally need a [transpiler](https://babeljs.io)) supports "arrow" functions:

{% highlight javascript %}
var a3 = a.map(s => s.length);
{% endhighlight %}

Mark's script lets you switch to this syntax with the `JsAnonFnToArrowFn` command.  The [source is commented](https://github.com/mvolkmann/vim-js-arrow-function/blob/master/ftplugin/javascript.vim) so you can figure out how it works and make your own language syntax changing scripts.
