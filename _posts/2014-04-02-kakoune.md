[Kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune) by Maxime Coste is a Vim-inspired editor that focuses on incremental editing using selections:

 > Kakoune works on selections, which are oriented, inclusive range of characters, selections have an anchor and a cursor character. Most commands move both of them, except when extending selection where the anchor character stays fixed and the cursor one moves around.

It's a C++/Boost project with ncurses and support for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows with Cygwin.

There's a video here that outlines the main features: [vimeo.com/82711574](http://vimeo.com/82711574).

I find it interesting that Kakoune focuses on selections, because I often try to avoid overusing selections in Vim.  I prefer to make small, repeatable movements and edits.  In the video there's an ASCII art Clippy image on a popup, so I wondered if the project was an April 1st joke, but I'm still trying to get it to build so I'll let you know!
