[Colortuner](https://github.com/zefei/vim-colortuner) by Zefei Xuan is a colour scheme editor that allows you to alter the scheme with sliders.  There's a slider for brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue.  You can also invert the scheme to see the dark/light version.

The interface also allows you to switch between themes, and you can specify a list of themes with `g:colortuner_preferred_schemes`.

The only downside of this plugin is it depends on either a GUI version of Vim, or Neovim in a true colour terminal.  Otherwise it looks very cool, and makes experimenting with themes easier than editing files.
