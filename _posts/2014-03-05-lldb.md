Ahoy there, fellow binary wrangler.  If you work with LLDB and want better Vim integration, then you may want to take a look at Tobias Pflug's [vim-lldb](https://github.com/gilligan/vim-lldb).  It's a fork of LLVM's [Vim plugin](http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/lldb/trunk/utils/vim-lldb/) -- the goal of the fork was to simply remove the pathogen dependency and improve the documentation.

Tobias thinks the script is useful but underused, so he'd like to get people to try it out.  It requires Vim 7.3 and above, and the lldb executable needs to be in the current path.

It supports breakpoints, watchpoints, threads, and locals.  That's pretty much everything I use from Xcode anyway, minus the beachballs which I hear are an exclusive feature baked into Xcode.
