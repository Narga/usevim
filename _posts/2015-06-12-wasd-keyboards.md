I saw people talking about [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com) because apparently they now sell Vim layouts.  WASD Keyboards sells mechanical keyboards, and part of the order process is a detailed customisation stage.  You get all kinds of cool options, like switch type (Cherry Blue, Green, etc.), and even sound dampeners.

If you select the [WASD V2 87-Key Custom Mechanical Keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-87-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html), you should see "Vim Black" and "Vim White" under the "Alphanumeric Layout Style" section.  Vim Black looks like this:

You can even select the OS key (including blank, Windows, Mac, and Linux)!

The keyboard that's compatible with the Vim layout costs around $145, and [international shipping is available](http://support.wasdkeyboards.com/customer/portal/articles/1374968-shipping). I don't own one of these keyboards, but they seem to be highly regarded by gamers (and Vim users). The next time I'm in the market for a keyboard I'll definitely consider one of these!
