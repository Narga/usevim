November is [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/)!  On the NaNoWriMo forum, [NewMexicoKid started a thread](http://nanowrimo.org/forums/nano-technology/threads/122633) about using Vim for writing:

> Starting a new thread on Vim because just today I discovered some power plugins and tools that I hadn't been aware of before; and that makes me think that there must be other Vim users out there who have still other Vim-related tips and tricks to share.

He's also created a summary of the tips from that thread: [Vim for Writers](http://naperwrimo.org/wiki/index.php?title=Vim_for_Writers).

One interesting point he makes on the Vim for Writers page is how to handle highlights.  I find I make a lot of highlights and annotations when researching and writing, but I've never thought about using Vim for that.  The two solutions mentioned are [vim-notebook](https://github.com/wdicarlo/vim-notebook) and [QFN](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2216).
