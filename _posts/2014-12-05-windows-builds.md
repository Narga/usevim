There's a really useful resource on [r/vim](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) about [alternative Vim builds for Windows](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2o560o/alternative_to_haroogans_vim_builds/).  The official Vim homepage doesn't list all the builds that users would like, and this includes 64-bit and extra language bindings.

Some of the suggested links include builds with Perl, Python 2 and 3, Ruby, Lua, and TCL, so if you're having trouble getting plugins working in your version of Vim for Windows then you might want to try these out.
