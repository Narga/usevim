In [Habit breaking, habit making](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/02/habit-breaking-habit-making/), Drew Neil mentions avoiding using motions that only move the cursor one row or column at a time.  [Hard Mode](https://github.com/wikitopian/hardmode) by Matt Parrott and Xeross takes this idea further by adding `HardMode()` to Vim which removes all character-wise navigation:

> The philosophy behind Hard Mode is that you'll never master Vim's advanced motion and search functionality if you can fall back on the anti-pattern of fumbling around your code with the arrow keys.

That makes it an interesting way to force yourself to master a larger repertoire of motions, like `fFtT` and `,`.

Meanwhile, [Medium Mode](https://github.com/kbarrette/mediummode), by Keith Barrette is less strict than Hard Mode:

{% highlight text %}
g:mediummode_motion_keys

  Set the list of motion keys that medium mode will remap

    Default: ['h', 'j', 'k', 'l', '<Left>', '<Right>', '<Up>', '<Down>']
{% endhighlight %}

The looser defaults in Medium Mode make it able to cope with the times when you actually do want to just move a single line or character.
