I'm a _search don't sort_ kind of guy, so when I was trying to make sense of gigabytes of XML files I instinctively reached for `ack`.  Unfortunately `ack` struggled with this unholy corpus of legacy drivel.  Overhearing my dismay [a coworker](https://twitter.com/bpb) asked "why aren't you using Silver Searcher?"

It turns out that [The Silver Search](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) made light work the XML files, so I looked at how to plug it into Vim.  The command-line parameters are compatible with Ack, so all I had to do was change the `ackprg`:

{% highlight text %}
let g:ackprg = 'ag --nogroup --nocolor --column'
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to use the same plugin as me, it's [mileszs / ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim).

The Silver Searcher's documentation claims it's 3-5 times faster than Ack, and in practice I've found this to be true.  It's visibly faster on the projects I'm currently working on, so I'm happy with it after a few weeks of use.
