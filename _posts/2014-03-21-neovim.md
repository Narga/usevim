[Neovim's funding drive](https://www.bountysource.com/fundraisers/539-neovim-first-iteration) is currently at $27,069 (271% of the goal).  The 30k stretch goal is to refactor Vim into a reusable library:

> $30,000: Refactor the editor into a library. It will require changing the way vim reads input or emits output. More details here. This will allow programs to embed the editor in the same process for better efficiency(no more marshalling of json/msgpack documents between the GUI and the core).

If you want to support the project then you better move quickly!
