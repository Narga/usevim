###ingo-library

Ingo Karkat has released [ingo-library](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4433), which contains all of the common `autoload` functions that he uses with his scripts.  In his documentation he mentions previous initiatives for developing a Vim "standard library", which I think is an interesting idea.

Ingo has included a function for opening external instances of Vim, and functions for working with Vim error messages and warnings.

###Evil

This isn't a Vim plugin, but an Emacs major mode called [Evil](https://gitorious.org/evil).  It effectively provides a vi layer for Emacs, and offers support for some well-known plugins through [Evil ports](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil#toc5).

The [Evil documentation](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) is quite detailed, so jump in if you're not afraid to experiment with Emacs.
