Sometimes I accidentally open a png or jpg with Vim, and it shows me a face-melting representation of the binary data.  If you do this enough it gets annoying, so instead I've been using Ashish Anand's [image.vim](https://github.com/ashisha/image.vim) to render ASCII previews of images.

Converting images to ASCII is an old trick that you can do pretty easily on the command-line (at least it's easy in Linux), but the thing I liked about this plugin is it uses an autocmd to run whenever an image is opened:

{% highlight text %}
au BufRead *.png,*.jpg,*.jpeg :call DisplayImage()
{% endhighlight %}

It uses the Python Imaging Library (`pip install Pillow`) to render the ASCII image, which you may find easier to install than the equivalent command-line tools.
