###tips.vim

[tips.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4094) (GitHub: [yesmeck / tips.vim](https://github.com/yesmeck/tips.vim)) by Wei Zhu is a small Ruby-based script that displays tips when Vim is launched.  Tips are displayed in the status line, and `:NextTip` will show another one.

The tips are downloaded from the [vim-tips.org](http://vim-tips.org/) site, which allows tips to be posted and commented on.

###vim-brunch

[vim-brunch](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4102) (GitHub: [drichard / vim-brunch](https://github.com/drichard/vim-brunch)) by David Richard is a vim-rails-inspired project management plugin for the [HTML5 app development library, Brunch](http://brunch.io/).  It works a lot like vim-rails, for example, `:Bmodel` opens a model, and `:Bcontroller` opens a controller.  It can be used to automate most (if not all) of Brunch development without leaving Vim.
