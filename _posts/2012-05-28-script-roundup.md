###Buffet

![Buffet](/images/posts/buffet.png)

[Buffet](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3896) (GitHub: [sandeepcr529 / Buffet.vim](https://github.com/sandeepcr529/Buffet.vim)) by "Sandeep CR" is an alternative way of viewing buffers.  It has commands for opening buffers in split windows, tabs, or closing the window associated with the buffer.

###OnSyntaxChange

[OnSyntaxChange](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4085) (GitHub: [vim-scripts / OnSyntaxChange](https://github.com/vim-scripts/OnSyntaxChange), License: _Vim_) by Ingo Karkat will generate events when the cursor moves into text that matches a particular syntax group.  This could be combined with an `:autocmd` for executing commands that coincide with the syntax group.
