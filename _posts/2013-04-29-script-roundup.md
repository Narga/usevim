###Join

[Join](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4516) (GitHub: [sk1418 / Join](https://github.com/sk1418/Join)) by Kai Yuan is an enhanced `:join` command.  It can join lines with a separator, trim whitespace, join lines in reverse and even join lines while leaving the original content.

The command's syntax is `:[range]Join[!] [separator] [count] [flags]`.  The GitHub project readme has further details and screenshots.

###reprocessed.vim

[reprocessed.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4551) (GitHub: [willpragnell / vim-reprocessed](https://github.com/willpragnell/vim-reprocessed)) by Will Pragnell brings some [Processing](http://processing.org/) support to Vim.  It adds syntax highlighting for the Processing language, documentation integration, and it can invoke sketches from Vim.

The author has provided Vundle and Pathogen installation instructions, and some usage guidelines in the GitHub project readme.
