<strong>Hint:</strong> To make Vim behave exactly as it does in this post's video, download <a href="https://gist.github.com/2709590">mouse-vimrc</a> and run Vim with <code>vim -u mouse-vimrc</code>.

Console Vim works shockingly well with the mouse.  Selections can be made, windows resized -- all without using gVim or MacVim.  I've written about training yourself to use `hjkl` instead of the arrow keys before, and while I'd encourage people to learn the window management keys, the mouse options are worth trying out.

There are two important options: `mouse` and `ttymouse`, and both have associated documentation (`:help 'mouse'`, `:help 'ttymouse'`).  The first option enables the mouse, and I usually set this to `a` which means the mouse will work in the Normal, Insert, Visual, and Command-line modes.

The other option, `ttymouse`, changes what "mouse codes" Vim will recognise.  I found `xterm2` worked well with [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) in Mac OS, but I was unable to get Lion's standard Terminal to work.

It's also worth checking out the `ttyfast` option as well.  It's meant to cause Vim to send more characters when redrawing, but it feels fast either way on my machine.

All together that gives the following:

{% highlight viml %}
" Send more characters for redraws
set ttyfast

" Enable mouse use in all modes
set mouse=a

" Set this to the name of your terminal that supports mouse codes.
" Must be one of: xterm, xterm2, netterm, dec, jsbterm, pterm
set ttymouse=xterm2
{% endhighlight %}

You can see me playing around with these settings in this short video:
