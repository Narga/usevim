JavaScript is moving pretty fast, so you might find Vim's built-in syntax lags behind the latest standards and APIs.  [YAJS: Yet Another JavaScript Syntax](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim) by othree is an extended version of [jelera/vim-javascript-syntax](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax).  It includes support for ES6, web APIs, and DOM keywords.

The ES6 support is extremely good -- it supports features like fat arrow, array comprehensions, and the template strings.

I took a screenshot of YAJS vs. the built in highlighting, and you can see how it handles arrow functions, template strings, and some of the newer keywords:
