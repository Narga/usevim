###Vader.vim

[Vader.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4832) is a unit testing framework for Vim scripts.  It has a BDD style syntax (`Do`, `Given`, `Expect`), and tests are run with the `Vader` command.

Test file should have the `.vader` extension.  You can split tests into multiple files by using `Include`.  The author has included examples of Vader being used to test real-world projects, including [vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak/blob/master/tests/test.vader).

###Textabyss

[Textabyss](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4835) by Liang Li is a plugin for panning around lots of files.  It organises files into columns, and allows you to scroll through columns quickly using the mouse.  It's a unique idea that's best explained [in a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTIaI_kI_X8).
