###vim-airline-todo

[vim-airline-todo](https://github.com/Zuckonit/vim-airline-todo) (License: _MIT_) is an extension for [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) that shows a count in the status bar for your current to-do list.

The count is based on the number of files in a directory.  Each task is a file, so it's a minimalist approach to managing to-do lists.  The task list directory can be changed, as can the `TODO` text.

###vimcaps

[vimcaps](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4834) (GitHub: [suxpert / vimcaps](https://github.com/suxpert/vimcaps), License: _GPL_) allows you to remap the caps lock key, in case you don't want to turn it off system-wide.  It includes a C program for toggling the behaviour of the key, so the author is looking for help porting it to Mac OS X because he doesn't have a Mac.
