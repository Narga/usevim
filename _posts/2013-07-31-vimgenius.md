[VimGenius](http://vimgenius.com/) is a web-based service for learning and practicing Vim.  It's influenced by VimTutor, but is structured around levels much like [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/).  You can pick beginner or intermediate courses depending on your current skill level.

The first page you see after starting the beginner course shows the material that will be covered by the subsequent exercises.  You're expected to memorise these commands.  If you forget any, which is likely, you can ask for a hint by pressing the right arrow key.

Exercises work by posing a question, like "delete two words", to which you respond by typing the equivalent key sequence.  Questions are timed, so you can improve your response speed over time.

It can be difficult to mentally translate English representations of Vim commands, but I found I got the hang of it after a while.  I'm not sure how well this would help someone learn Vim, but it's worth giving a shot if you're looking for new ways to develop fluency.
