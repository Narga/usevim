> It took over 120 total hours to research, plan, design and create this cheat-sheet. It is meant to be a collection of Vim's "biggest bang for your buck" features: the stuff that will provide the most usefulness to the most people.

The [Vim Cheat Sheet Poster](http://vimcheatsheet.com/products/vim-cheat-sheet-poster) by Max Cantor is a carefully created movie-sized poster for key Vim editing commands and concepts.  It was started as a [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxcantor/beautiful-vim-cheat-sheet-poster), and was fully-funded by 467 backers.

It sells for $25 and is printed on some pretty heavy matte paper.  There's also a [high quality digital version](http://vimcheatsheet.com/products/vim-cheat-sheet-digital) available for $10.
