I've tried a lot of Vim browser plugins before -- whether in Chrome or Firefox there are a lot of choices now.  One project that's new to me is [qutebrowser](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser), which is actually a browser rather than a browser extension.

It's got a [keybinding cheatsheet](http://qutebrowser.org/img/cheatsheet-big.png), so you can see how similar to Vim it is.  It's based on PyQt5 and QtWebKit, and has a minimal GUI that wouldn't look out of place on a tiling window manager.  In fact, it was [inspired by dwb](http://portix.bitbucket.org/dwb/), which is influenced by Vimperator.

The readme lists similar projects, which includes a GTK-based browser called [vimb](http://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb/).  So if your system only has GTK then you may prefer to install that.
