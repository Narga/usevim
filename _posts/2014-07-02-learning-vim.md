[Learning Vim in 2014: Vim as Language](http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/) is one of a series of posts by Ben McCormick about learning "modern" Vim.  It takes the approach of describing Vim in terms of grammar, which I think was nicely encapsulated by the famous [You Don't Grok Vi](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118/306167) comment on StackOverflow.

On motions, Ben writes:

> If you're a grammar nerd or remember your 8th grade english classes, you can think of these as transitive verbs that need to act on a direct object. These "direct objects" come in 2 forms, motions and text objects. Motions are the motion commands that you can use at any time to move around Vim.

Also, the [post is on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7976493), so it would be nice to upvote it to encourage Ben to keep posting!
