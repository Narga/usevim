Vim is available for many platforms, including Windows.  Although it has a strong association with Unix, thanks to the heritage of vi, Vim was originally released on the [Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) (my favourite computer and OS of all time).  Over the years Vim has been adapted to various systems and has platform-specific features.  In this tutorial I'm going to introduce using Vim for Windows, and discuss a few Windows-specific options.

###Download and Installation

To download Vim for Windows, go to Vim's site, select _Downloads_, then scroll down to [PC: MS-DOS and MS-Windows](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc).  I usually download the gVim executable installer, which has several options -- make sure you click "Create .bat files for command line use" if you want to run Vim from with `cmd.exe`:

###Running gVim and Vim

Once Vim's installed, it can be started from the desktop or the start menu:

This provides some convenient shortcuts for pretty much everything available in typical Unix installations, including Vim Diff and Vim tutor.  Running gVim displays Vim inside a GUI, which is just like other GTK-based ports of gVim and similar to MacVim.   To start console Vim, either type `vim.exe` in Command Prompt, or run _Vim_ from the start menu.

###Basic Usage

Files can be opened by typing `:e filename`, but don't worry too much about typing the correct slash because Windows will internally map between forward and backslashes.  Typing `:help` will display the standard documentation and `:help win32` displays Windows-specific help.

Vim's split windows (`:help CTRL-W`) can be manipulated using the mouse by default -- this includes dragging to resize.  The "Window" menu in gVim provides an easy way to work with windows if you haven't learned the commands before.

###Configuration

Type `:e $HOME\_vimrc` to edit the current user's `vimrc` -- note the underscore.  As an example, let's disable the arrow keys to encourage ourselves to learn `hjkl` for movement:

{% highlight viml %}
" Disable arrow keys
inoremap  <Up>     <NOP>
inoremap <Down>   <NOP>
inoremap <Left>   <NOP>
inoremap <Right>  <NOP>
noremap  <Up>     <NOP>
noremap  <Down>   <NOP>
noremap  <Left>   <NOP>
noremap  <Right>  <NOP>
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file and quit by typing `:wq`.  Now reopen Vim or gVim, enter Insert mode by pressing `i`, type something, then try to move around with the arrow keys.

If you want to share your Vim configuration with a Unix system, you can add Windows-specific configuration options like this:

{% highlight viml %}
" Windows-specific settings
if has('win32')
  " Windows gVim-specific settings
  if has('gui_running')
  endif
endif
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the ALT keys in gVim will map to the underscored letters in the menus.  This is controlled by `'winaltkeys'`, and `menu` is the default.  When `menu` is set, keys that are not currently mapped by a menu item can be mapped to custom commands.  It can be turned off entirely by typing `:set wak=no`.
