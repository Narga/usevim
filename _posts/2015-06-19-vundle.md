I saw this issue in the Vundle (GitHub: [gmarik/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/)) repository: [Takeover Vundle #608](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/issues/608)

Following the advice [Shougo](https://github.com/Shougo) and the community, there's now a [VundleVim](https://github.com/VundleVim) organization, and a [reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3a4ie0/vundle_takeover_call_for_maintainers/).

It sounds like the main thing that's required of the project's maintainer is support.  Gmarik said [this on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/3a4ie0/vundle_takeover_call_for_maintainers/csa77a3):

> I've not been active for quite a while now, so for me it's communication I think. Many people still @nick me and expect some sort of help, but instead they should be asking an active maintainer instead. Transferring ownership will improve feedback loop.

Vundle is a popular Vim plugin manager, and it's the one I use for quickly testing out plugins for this blog.  It has over 8,000 GitHub stars, and over 400 watchers.  It's a pretty solid and mature project, so I hope someone picks up the slack!
