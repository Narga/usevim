[Mark Steve](http://marksteve.com/) sent in [rstacruz/vim-opinion](https://github.com/rstacruz/vim-opinion), a plugin that captures commonly used `.vimrc` settings so you can easily install and use it with Vundle or Pathogen.  It's designed to be used with Tim Pope's [sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible).

The [included documentation](https://github.com/rstacruz/vim-opinion/blob/master/doc/Starter_pack.md) has instructions on how to install it for beginners, so if you've never used Vundle before then you'll find this useful.

Most of the settings are what I've got in my `.vimrc`.  For example, `set ruler`, `set incsearch`, `syntax on`, and `set ttyfast`.  You should [check each setting](https://github.com/rstacruz/vim-opinion/blob/master/plugin/options.vim) before installing the whole thing, but using sensible.vim and vim-opinion is definitely preferable to installing a random `.vimrc` or dozens of plugins.
