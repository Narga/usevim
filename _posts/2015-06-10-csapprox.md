On [reddit/r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim) there's a post about adapting [dark colour schemes to transparent terminals](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/38wfdw/dark_color_schemes_that_dont_mess_with/). One way to solve this, as [suggested by gordin](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/38wfdw/dark_color_schemes_that_dont_mess_with/crydcd8), is to use [CSApprox](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390).

[CSApprox](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390) (GitHub: [godlygeek/csapprox](https://github.com/godlygeek/csapprox)) by Matt Wozniski can be used to convert gVim colour schemes to work with 256 colour terminals.  Many people now use 256 colour terminals, so if you use CSApprox with schemes that previously looked bad you should see something much closer to the right colours.

Versions of Vim after 7.3 don't need GUI support for CSApprox to work, so if you've got a modern version of Vim on a server without X then you should be able to see the colours you expect.
