The [Vim London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/) is a new event organised by Drew Neil, with a launch party planned for [Monday, October 29, 2012](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/events/87662312/).  They're currently looking for a location.

There are a lot of great regular events in London, I've been to a few of the [London Hacker News](http://www.meetup.com/HNLondon/) meetups, and lots of programming language user groups.  Hopefully Vim London will get off the ground to give us Vim addicts somewhere to drink too much and share techniques.
