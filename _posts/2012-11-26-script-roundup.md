###vimcat

[vimcat](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4325) (GitHub: [kitover / vimpager](https://github.com/rkitover/vimpager)) is a script for printing out syntax highlighted code to the terminal.  It's based on the [vimpager](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1723) project by Rafael Kitover.

This script is a little bit like less.sh (which you should have as part of your Vim distribution), but it's more elaborate.  It uses a combination of shell and Vim scripting to get Vim to work as a supercharged pager.

###SlowDown.vim

[SlowDown.vim](http://www.featurist.co.uk/blog/2012/11/14/slowdown-vim/) (GitHub: [artemave / slowdown.vim](https://github.com/artemave/slowdown.vim), License: _Vim_) by Artem Avetisyan is a plugin for _slowing down Vim_.  It causes an input delay, therefore compelling you to reconsider the commands you're using.

Whether this works or not is dependent on you, but I thought it was an interesting concept -- I'm always interested in new ways to learn Vim!
