###Angular.vim

[Angular.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4907) (GitHub: [burnettk / vim-angular](https://github.com/burnettk/vim-angular), License: _Vim_) by Kevin Burnett is a set of shortcuts for working with AngularJS projects.  Features include switching between test and implementation files (`:A`), goto file tweaks (`gf`), and spec runners.

###Clone

[Clone](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4896) by Ingo Karkat adds a `:CloneAs` command for copying the current buffer to a new file.

It keeps the current buffer intact and unmodified, and you can clone part of a file with a range as well (`:[range]CloneAs`).  It also supports cloning into a split window (`:[range]SCloneAs`).
