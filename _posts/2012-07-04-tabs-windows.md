Somebody recently asked me if I use split windows in Vim.  The answer is of course an emphatic "Yes!", but why?

It actually depends on the work I'm doing.  When writing prose, I'll typically use a single window and only split it if I need to refer to another file without losing my place.

When writing code, however, I'm likely to always split windows.  For example: a vertical split for a file and its associated unit test, and perhaps later an additional set of horizontal splits for associated view code (HTML templates or similar).

I find it's best to split windows as needed rather than working with a predefined set.  It's also useful to [take advantage of tabs](http://usevim.com/2012/06/08/js101-tabs/) to organise sets of windows in logical groups.  Or illogical -- whatever helps you to be productive!
