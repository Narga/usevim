###smartpairs

smartpairs (GitHub: [gorkunov / smartpairs.vim](https://github.com/gorkunov/smartpairs.vim), License: _wtfpl_) by Alexander Gorkunov is a plugin for visually selecting ranges based on brackets or quotes, without needing to type the brackets or quotes.  So rather than `vi{` you can type `viv` -- the last `v` will cause the plugin to search for the pair of the symbol under the cursor.  It's a nice tweak to the existing behaviour that seems easy to learn.

Alexander also sent in [smartgf.vim](https://github.com/gorkunov/smartgf.vim).  This is a method definition search plugin designed for Ruby.  Once the cursor is over a method name you should be able to type `gf` to search for related methods.  The results are obtained using The Silver Searcher, and each entry has a number so you can quickly jump to the corresponding file and location.

###ftcolor.vim

[ftcolor.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5028) (GitHub: [caglartoklu / ftcolor.vim](https://github.com/caglartoklu/ftcolor.vim), License: _BSD 2-clause_) by Caglar Toklu is a handy plugin for switching colour scheme based on language.  That means you could have a totally different scheme for JavaScript or Lisp code, for example.

It has some configuration options, like `g:ftcolor_default_color_scheme` and then one for each language (`g:ftcolor_color_mappings.python`).  It also supports light and dark options.  All of this is documented in the readme.
