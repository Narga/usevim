###Git Shade

[Git Shade](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4644) (GitHub: [joeytwiddle / git_shade.vim](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/git_shade.vim)) by Paul Clark is a GUI mode plugin that adds colour highlights based on changes in Git's history.  It has some configuration options for colours, and can increase the intensity of the shading with `let g:GitShade_Linear = 0`.

I really like [Vim Git Gutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) in console mode, so check that out if you haven't seen it before.

###accelerated-smooth-scroll

[accelerated-smooth-scroll](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4640) (GitHub: [yonchu / accelerated-smooth-scroll](https://github.com/yonchu/accelerated-smooth-scroll)) by Yonchu makes Vim's scroll speed appear to increase and decrease, giving the illusion of acceleration you might find in desktop applications.  The author has made a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGMgAiS8Xtg) so you can see what it looks like without downloading it.
