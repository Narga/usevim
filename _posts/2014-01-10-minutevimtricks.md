I've been watching [MinuteVimTricks](http://www.youtube.com/user/MinuteVimTricks), which I found [on reddit/r/vim](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1tzqjy/ive_started_making_vim_video_tutorials/).  The author has made eight videos that cover everything from [plugins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzN4h4dj4cE), to [colour schemes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pX9zMIKeuY) and using the [help system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVON1yvfz7A).

If you want more videos, take a look at [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/) if you haven't seen it before!
