I'm peering out at you through a haze of Christmas dinner and fairy lights, finding a welcome distraction from assembling toys and cooking.  I've written about many plugins over the last year, but I use two regularly, so I'd like to offer these morsels up as my plugins of the year.

The first is [Seek](http://usevim.com/2013/01/28/script-roundup/), by Vic Goldfeld.  Seek adds a new motion, `s`, for jumping based on two characters.  There have been iterations on this idea since then, but I liked the simplicity of it, and the fact that it feels like built-in functionality.

The next is [vim-signify](http://usevim.com/2013/04/15/script-roundup/).  It shows linewise changes in a file, so you can easily see what lines have changed if you're using a version control system like Git.

Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and I look forward to writing more about Vim in 2014!
