[Primary](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5160) (GitHub: [google/vim-colorscheme-primary](https://github.com/google/vim-colorscheme-primary)) by Lisie Michel at Google is a colour scheme based on Google's branding.  The GUI version uses Google's exact colours, while the 256 and 8 colour versions are approximations.

I usually have a dark terminal, but I noticed Primary looks really nice in the light colour scheme mode.  I don't usually write about colour schemes, but this one interested me because it's actually on Google's GitHub repository and looks good in light mode.
