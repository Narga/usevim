I was at a VimGolf evening at [Vim London](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/) a few months ago, and one thing I picked up there was the use of `ZZ`.  If you look at [VimGolf](http://vimgolf.com/) solutions, a lot use `ZZ` to write and close the file.  If multiple windows (split buffers) are open, it'll write and close that window.  If you're in Normal mode, this is shorter than typing `:wq`.

There's also `ZQ`, which quits without saving changes.  `ZQ` is equivalent to `:q!` rather than `:qa!`, which quits _all_ windows and Vim entirely.

I like these marginally more efficient ways to quit Vim -- I use `ZZ` more than `:wq` or `CTRL-W c` (which just closes a window).  Vim's documentation covers all of these commands and more under _Writing and quitting_ (`:help write-quit`).
