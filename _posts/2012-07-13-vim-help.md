Vim's documentation is amazingly detailed and consistent.  It's usually the first place I look for help, before even lazily typing in a query into a search engine.  Admittedly, the documentation can be daunting for beginners.  Let's address that now!

###Help is Context Sensitive

Pressing escape to ensure Vim's in Normal mode and then typing `:help` and return will display the main Vim help page.  Typing `:help subject` will search for a given subject.  The help file is opened and displayed in a read-only window, usually in a split window at the top of the screen.  This window can be closed by entering `:q`, just like any other file.

Searching for subjects is context sensitive.  If you need help on a Visual mode command, then prepend it with `v_`.  Similarly, Insert mode commands are prepended with `i_` -- for example, `:help i_CTRL-P` will display the help for completion.

The options we set using `:set option` are found by using single quotes: try entering `:help 'write'` and compare it to `:help write`.  It took me a while to remember this, I seem to distantly remember confusing help lookups for similar commands for Normal mode and options.

To read about the rest of these context-sensitive help searches, type `:help help-context`.

###Completion

The `:help` command supports tab completion if `wildmenu` has been set.  See `help 'wildmenu'` for help on that.  The completion algorithm is actually pretty smart, it'll correctly include single quotes for options, and it even recognises all of those `i_` keyboard shortcuts.

###Navigation

The help pages themselves can be navigated easily by memorising the `<C-]>` command.  Pressing `<C-]>` over a term (highlighted or not) will attempt to jump to a matching help subject.  If the [mouse](http://usevim.com/2012/05/16/mouse/) is enabled, then double-clicking a word is equivalent.

Pressing `<C-T>` (or `<C-RightMouse>`) will jump back to the previous location.  This is a good way to easily go back through previous pages in case you get lost.

###Searching

What happens when you don't even know the name of a help subject to look up?  Well, it's possible to search through the help using `:helpgrep` (or `:helpg`).  Regular expressions can be used, and to ignore case type `:helpg term\c`.

###Shortcuts

There are also shortcuts to certain sections.  Rather than typing `:help normal-index` for help on Normal mode, `:viu` can be typed instead.  Also, `:h` is an alias for `:help`.
