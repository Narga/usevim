There's an Area 51 proposal to get a [vi/Vim Stack Exchange site going](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/76728/vi-vim).  The way this works is enough people have to commit to use it.  Right now it's 45% complete with 91 people who are committed.

I read a discussion about [whether Vim questions belong elsewhere](http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/questions/18011/isnt-this-on-topic-on-unix-linux-or-superuser), but due to the volume of Vim questions across Stack Overflow I think it's a reasonable proposal.

People already find a huge wealth of Vim advice on Stack Overflow -- I still find discussions about the ["you don't grok vi"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118) post, so a more vi/Vim focused community would be very interesting.
