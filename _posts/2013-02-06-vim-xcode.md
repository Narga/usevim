As I've mentioned before, I do freelance work as an iOS developer.  This is, of course, awkward and painful as a Vim user because it can be a challenge to work productively outside of Apple's IDE.  I like to keep tabs on resources for working with Vim and iOS/Mac development, so here's one of my latest finds: a detailed post by Benedikt Terhechte about [using Vim as an Xcode alternative](http://appventure.me/2013/01/use-vim-as-xcode-alternative-ios-mac-cocoa.html).   The author explains how to install [Clang Complete](https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete), and some additional libraries like [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) and [ios.vim](https://github.com/eraserhd/vim-ios).

The Carbon Five blog also has lots of resources for working with Xcode outside of the GUI.  [Building Xcode 4 projects from the command line](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2011/04/06/building-xcode-4-projects-from-the-command-line/) has some help for dealing with `xcodebuild`, although if I remember correctly I last got automated builds working by [following this answer on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5010680/306167).
