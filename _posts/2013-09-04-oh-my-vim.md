[Oh My Vim!](https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim) is a Vim plugin manager inspired by the widely used [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).  It requires Python, but has some interesting features like a plugin registry.  You can view the [registry on GitHub](https://github.com/gawel/oh-my-vim/blob/master/ohmyvim/config.ini).

It can be used from within Vim through the `:OhMyVim` command, which also supports completion.  This allows you to issue commands like `:OhMyVim install` and `:OhMyVim remove`.

If you want to submit your own Vim plugins to the plugin registry make a change to `ohmyvim/config.ini` and submit a pull request.
