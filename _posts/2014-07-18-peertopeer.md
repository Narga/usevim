![Peer to Peer](/images/posts/peertopeer.png)

[Peer to Peer](http://peertopeer.io/) has launched!  This is a service by Drew Neil of Vimcasts.  The idea is that an expert demonstrates how they solve problems using their preferred tools, while they're filmed both in-person and on-screen.

[The first episode](http://peertopeer.io/videos/1-tom-stuart/) is Counting Tree Nodes with Tom Stuart.  Tom uses Vim, and you can see him using it to write a Ruby project that uses Cucumber, Rspec, and immutable data structure APIs.

The video costs $25, and comes with a Git repository and an essay by Tom.  The video is 120 minutes and DRM-free.
