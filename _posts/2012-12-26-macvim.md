MacVim [snapshot 66](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/wiki/ChangeLog) was released earlier this month, which has some bug fixes and updates Vim to 7.3.754.

Bjorn has also moved the binary releases to Google Code, because GitHub has stopped hosting binaries.  If you're looking for the latest MacVim release, remember to download it from here: [code.google.com/p/macvim/downloads/list](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/downloads/list).

MacVim development continues on GitHub.
