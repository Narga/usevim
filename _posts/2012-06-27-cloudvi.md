![Cloud Vi](/images/posts/cloudvi.png)

[Cloud Vi](http://mit.edu/~georgiou/www/vi/) by [Thomas Georgiou](https://twitter.com/#!/tagx) is a mashup of [jsvi](http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/) and [Filepicker.io](https://www.filepicker.io/).  The original _jsvi_ JavaScript project is almost 4,000 lines of JavaScript, with cross-browser support and almost all of vi's keys and Ex commands.

By adding [Filepicker.io](https://www.filepicker.io/), Thomas has injected new life into jsvi because it enables it to save files to Dropbox and Box.net.  Files can also be loaded by typing `:e file` -- a dialog box will appear that allows imports from Dropbox, Facebook, GitHub, and more services.

This is all done with client-side JavaScript, so technically Cloud Vi isn't dependent on Thomas' website.  One thing I'd like to see is the project on GitHub so other people can fork it and hack it.
