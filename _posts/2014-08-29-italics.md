In [Enabling italic fonts in iTerm2, tmux, and vim](https://alexpearce.me/2014/05/italics-in-iterm2-vim-tmux/), Alex Pearce explains the steps required to get italic fonts working in console Vim on a Mac.  You'll need a font that supports italics, like Consolas, and some configuration for iTerm, tmux, and Vim.

> I really like having comments in italic. It differentiates them one step more from the surrounding code, and it makes sense semantically too, as a comment is treated very differently from anything else in the source.

Because Alex's solution changes the value of `$TERM`, you might see errors when sshing to remote servers.  He explains how to extract the termcap values, but you could alias `ssh` to `TERM=xterm-256color ssh`.
