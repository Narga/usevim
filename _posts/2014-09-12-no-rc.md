Most people end up with huge `.vimrc` files and lots of configuration options.  That can make using a standard installation of Vim tricky.  So just how much vanilla Vim do you remember?

First, start Vim like this:

{% highlight text %}
vim -u NONE
{% endhighlight %}

The `-u` option lets you change the `.vimrc` that Vim loads, so in this case no file will be used.  Now when you start Vim it'll behave more like vi.

The first thing I noticed was I kept getting `^I` instead of tab completion when trying to open files.  Cmdline mode doesn't support tab completion in Vi mode.  To get around this you can use `:set nocompatible` (`nocp`).  This actually sets multiple options, and enables things most of us take for granted like commandline history and `wildchar` for completion.

I don't use too many shortcuts so I don't find vanilla Vim that painful, but when I'm doing serious work I immediately miss workflow tools like The Silver Searcher and my tmux integration.
