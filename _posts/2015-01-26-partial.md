![Partial](/images/posts/partial.gif)

If you're a web developer one chore you might be familiar with is extracting reusable chunks from big templates into smaller files.  The [vim-partial](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5094) (GitHub: [jbgutierrez/vim-partial](https://github.com/jbgutierrez/vim-partial)) plugin by Javier Blanco Guti√©rrez automates the process by creating a new file based on a selection and inserting the necessary `include` line.

Some existing plugins do this, but they're typically tied to a specific language or framework.  This project is more generic and configurable -- it understands how to extract things like ejs, stylus, erb, and haml, but you can extend it by setting `g:partial_templates`.  You can also change where the output files are stored with `g:partial_templates_roots`, and you can even make it show the new file in a split window.
