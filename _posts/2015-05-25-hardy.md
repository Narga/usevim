That Arduino IDE isn't too bad, but you'd probably prefer to use Vim for Arduino development.  [Hardy](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5180) (GitHub: [4Evergreen4/vim-hardy](https://github.com/4Evergreen4/vim-hardy)) provides Arduino support for Vim.  With it, you can type `:ArduinoVerify` to check an Arduino file, and `:ArduinoUpload` to compile and upload it.  You'll still need to have installed the Arduino IDE for this to work, because it comes with the tools required for compilation.

Hardy also includes an Arduino syntax file.  The name "Hardy" comes from the fact "Arduino" means "hardy friend" in Italian, and this script is a friend of Arduino (or a friend of yours if you're not a fan of the IDE).
