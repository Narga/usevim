Last week I wrote about [Vim's registers](http://www.usevim.com/2012/04/13/registers/), and this week you'll see one of the many reasons why they're essential, in the form of `CTRL-R`.

###Inserting Registers in Insert Mode

When writing in insert mode, it's possible to paste a register at the current location _without leaving insert mode_.  To do this, press `CTRL-R` then type the name of a register.  For example, `CTRL-R a` will insert the contents of `a`.

The text is inserted as if it were typed: that means `autoindent` will be respected.  Pressing `CTRL-R` twice will insert the text literally.

###Expression Register

Typing `CTRL-R =` allows an expression to be entered -- press return to insert the result.  This could be any expression, but an easy to learn trick is to use it for simple mathematics.

Let's say I wanted to insert the number of milliseconds in a day.  Rather than leaving Vim and using a calculator or REPL, I could type `CTRL-R =1000 * 60 * 60 * 24` and "86400000" will be inserted at the current position.

###Command Mode

Typing `CTRL-R` in _command mode_ (not normal mode) will also insert the contents of a register.

###Further Reading

For more on using `CTRL-R` in insert mode, see `:help i_CTRL-R`.  The command mode equivalent is also documented in `:help c_CTRL-R`.
