###Vimdeck

![Vimdeck](/images/posts/vimdeck.png)

[Vimdeck](http://vimdeck.tybenz.com/) (GitHub: [tybenz / vimdeck](https://github.com/tybenz/vimdeck), License: _MIT_) by Tyler Benziger is a plugin for showing presentations.  It uses Markdown, and renders headers with fonts that look like [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/).  Code is syntax highlighted, and images are turned into ASCII art.

###noerrmsg.vim

Apparently, some plugins like YouCompleteMe generate unwanted error messages that can't be turned off.  Hector Arciga wrote a plugin that intercepts these errors and changes the text colours so you can't see them: [noerrmsg.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4770).

So if you really can't stand those errors, then you can at least sweep them under the carpet by making them invisible (depending on your terminal setup).
