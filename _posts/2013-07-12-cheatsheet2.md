![Vim Poster](/images/posts/vimposter.png)

I already wrote about the [Vim Cheat Sheet Poster](http://vimcheatsheet.com/products/vim-cheat-sheet-poster) by Max Cantor [last year](http://usevim.com/2012/09/05/cheatsheet/).  I had it hanging in my office and referred to it numerous times while working and writing this blog.  The new version [can be pre-ordered](http://vimcheatsheet.com/blogs/news/8299173-now-accepting-2-0-pre-orders) and costs $25 plus shipping.  There will be a sneak peek on July 31st.

The last version was good quality, although slightly heavy so it fell off my wall a few times (I used Blu-Tack but it really needs pins).  If you're interested in getting yourself a large Vim cheat sheet I'd order now to help Max get the project going:

> I'll be funding the second print run with income from the pre-orders, similar to how the Kickstarter worked. This pre-order option is for people who want to give extra support to the project and have a unique opportunity at providing feedback during the design process.
