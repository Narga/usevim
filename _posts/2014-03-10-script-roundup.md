  <small>A sample of t9md's work.</small>
</div>

A reader sent in [t9md's GitHub profile](https://github.com/t9md?tab=repositories), which contains some cool Vim projects:

* [vim-choosewin](https://github.com/t9md/vim-choosewin) has a tmux-inspired window numbering system
* [vim-ezbar](https://github.com/t9md/vim-ezbar) is a minimalist status bar plugin
* [vim-smalls](https://github.com/t9md/vim-smalls) supports EasyMotion-style jumping with highlighting, fold skipping, and more features
* [vim-chef](https://github.com/t9md/vim-chef), a plugin for jumping around Chef recipes

The person that sent this in said they discovered t9md when looking at [Shougo](https://github.com/Shougo)'s `.vimrc`.  He has also written lots of cool Vim projects, like Unite.vim and NeoBundle.

There are many more plugins than the ones I've mentioned here, so I think it's worth exploring t9md's projects to see what else he's made.
