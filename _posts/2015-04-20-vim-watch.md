[Sri Kadimisetty](http://sri.io) has been working on Vim video tutorials at [Vim.Watch](http://vim.watch).  They're short, five minute tutorials that are focused on a single topic or command.  For example, [sesionoptions](http://vim.watch/sessionoptions/) covers Vim's session management features.

If you enjoy these and want to see more Vim video tutorials, I also noticed [MinuteVimTricks](https://www.youtube.com/user/MinuteVimTricks) posted a new video two weeks ago.
