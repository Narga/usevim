![Vim keycap](/images/posts/vimkeycap.png)

There's a [competition going on at reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/zq97e/alright_rvim_win_a_free_vim_keycap_heres_a/) to win a free Vim keycap, available for purchase through [techkeys.us](http://www.techkeys.us/).  The actual key itself is designed to fit Cherry MX keys along the top two rows.

In my quest for the perfect keyboard, I've also found some interesting keyboards and keycaps available through [EliteKeyboards](http://elitekeyboards.com/), and [The Keyboard Company](http://www.keyboardco.com/) who are based in the UK and resell through Amazon.
