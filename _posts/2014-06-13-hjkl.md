I use `hjkl`, after disabling arrow keys for a few months.  If you don't use `hjkl`, I think you should try it because it's a lot easier to get used to than you might think.  You just have to dive in to the deep end and practice.

[hjkl and touch typing](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/27w82b/hjkl_and_touch_typing/) is a post on reddit by [benekastah](http://www.reddit.com/user/benekastah) that asks if it would be more optimal to move the keys to the natural home keys, like `jkl;`.

There are some interesting points raised in the discussions, like this one by Syfrix:

> I've never officially learned to touchtype so I'm not familiar with the "right" positions of my fingers. I have four of my fingers on hjkl and that works fine for me.
> Interestingly, the default configuration of the i3 window manager uses jkl; as directional keys. I changed this to hjkl to make it consistent with vim and my browser, but maybe you'd want to try it out on vim?

But then Sphaerophoria said:

> You shouldn't be doing single character motions enough that you need to move your hand over.

Which fits in with [Drew Neil's idea about trying to make repeatable edits](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/creating-repeatable-mappings-with-repeat-vim/).

I don't mind moving my finger over to `h`, so I don't think I'll ever leave `hjkl`.
