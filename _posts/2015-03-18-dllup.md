I find myself using technologies that are easy to write in plain text.  This is partly so I can use Vim, but also because I find it less distracting.  I write my blog posts in Markdown with Vim for example, and much prefer this approach to web-based blog engines.

Markdown doesn't work so well for books, however, particularly if you want things like figures and equations.  I stumbled onto a [Show HN about a new markup language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9193560) called dllup, created by Daniel Lawrence Lu.  This markup language solves the problems of Markdown for academic writing, and has a pretty sensible philosophy:

* The raw text file must be fast to type up
* The output must be semantically correct HTML5
* It should be simple, consistent, correct

The documentation is here: <http://www.dllu.net/programming/dllup/>, and there are examples for article headers, code, equations, tables, and more.  It definitely feels like a compelling combination of LaTeX and Markdown.  It even supports compilation to LaTeX, so you can use the standard LaTeX-based tools for generating PDFs.

There's even a [Vim syntax file](http://www.dllu.net/programming/dllup/#s4.3), so you can start writing dllup documents in Vim right away.

Because dllup supports article headers it seems like a good solution for static blog generators as well.  Particularly technical blogs, where code highlight and equation support is useful.
