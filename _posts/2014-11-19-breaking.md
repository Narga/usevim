I've been reading a series of articles by Dan Prince about why he loves Vim.  The second article is about how a broken laptop keyboard forced him to get better at Vim.

> One day the left arrow key on my laptop broke. It completely stopped working.
>
> This was at a time when I had projects to finish at work, assignments to write for University and I was attempting to devote time to working on personal projects too.
>
> By the end of the week, I was using the home keys to navigate at my usual speed.

This is a new take on the "why hjkl is awesome" argument, but Dan's posts are well illustrated and should win some beginners over to doing things the hard (right) way.
