I found [Why I Use Vim](http://jaxbot.me/articles/why-i-use-vim) by Jonathan Warner on [/r/vim](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1y24sd/why_i_use_vim_in_gif_form/), and I thought it was worth sharing due to the serious amount of gifs.

Some concepts are easier to illustrate graphically, and animations definitely help me when I'm trying to learn new Vim tricks.  Most of the ideas the author mentions are what I would consider Vim essentials, but they're illustrated in really practical ways.

He's got real code in the examples, so it helps see how to use the suggested techniques in daily editing chores.
