Programming is all about focus.  It's hard to focus when the phone's ringing, other people are talking about the latest terrible TV talent show, and there's a crazy busker outside attempting to cover Oasis - Wonderwall after several cans of Special Brew.  But that's life, and we can't do much about it (other than invest in a seriously good quality pair of headphones).  When it comes to code, however, we have to deal with a lot of noise -- implementation details that aren't relevant to the task at hand.  One way of mitigating this is _folding_ -- hiding parts of files based on various rules to help claw back some precious neurological capacity.

Vim supports six folding methods: manual, indent, expr, syntax, diff, and marker.  Let's look at manual and indent to introduce the basics.

###Manually Folding

Select a folding method by setting `foldmethod`, abbreviated to the more convenient `fdm`.  The default value is `manual`, so no folding occurs.  There are several ways to add folds:

* `zf{motion}`: Create a fold based on `motion`
* Visual selection, `zf`: Make a selection by first pressing `v` (or by using the mouse), then typing `zf` will fold the entire selection

Once a fold has been added, typing `zo` will open it, and `zc` will close it.  It's pretty easy to remember these fold-related commands because they start with `z`.  Another useful command is `zE` which will _elimate_ all folds in the current window.

Folds are specific to the current window and buffer, and all of these manual folds will be lost when the file is closed.  Folds can be saved by typing `:mkview`, then loaded again with `:loadview`.  These _view_ files are saved to `viewdir` -- try it out and have a look at `~/.vim/view/`.

###Indentation

Typing `:set fdm=indent` will change the fold method to an indentation-based algorithm.  The basic way to configure this is to set `foldlevel` which controls the level of indentation where folding will occur.

To better visualise folding, setting `foldcolumn` (or `fdc`) will display a sidebar that indicates what will be folded.  Try `:set foldcolumn=2` to see it in action.

In the screenshot above I'm editing the software that powers this blog, and I'm using the following settings:

{% highlight viml %}
set fdm=indent
set fdc=4
set fdl=1
{% endhighlight %}
