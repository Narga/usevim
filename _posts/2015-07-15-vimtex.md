Karl Yngve Lerv√•g sent in vimtex (GitHub: [lervag/vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex)), a script with lots of commands and mappings for LaTeX authors. It's inspired by [LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box), but is written from scratch with extensibility in mind.

Vimtex includes motions for section navigation and moving between matching delimiters, LaTeX-specific text objects, `texcount` integration, support for PDF viewers, and it even has completion for citations and labels. There are more features like mappings and improved syntax highlighting: read more in `:h vimtex`.

The documentation includes details on the [project's structure](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/blob/f1ee9e7b35d8cc31cdcadb3525e8670a2634d706/doc/vimtex.txt#L1314), so you can find out how vimtex initialises and manages state, and defines autocommands. If you're interested in extending vimtex with your own TeX-related features then the documentation helpfully provides enough details to get going!
