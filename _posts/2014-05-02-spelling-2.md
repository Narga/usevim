I wrote about [spell checking](http://usevim.com/2014/04/30/spelling/) in my last article, and there was a small but useful detail that I missed: skipping to the next misspelled word.  You can type `]s` to do this, and it helps when you're writing long text files.

In my case I write a lot of blog posts and even my books in Vim, so I now type `]sz=` instinctively.  To search backwards, use `[s`.

You can also add words to the dictionary, with `zg`.  You can think of this as "add _good_ word".
