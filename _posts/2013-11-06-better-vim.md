![Vim Star Wars crawl](/images/posts/vimstarwars.png)

I found [More Instantly Better Vim](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/10/more-instantly-better-vim.html) on [O'Reilly's programming blog](http://programming.oreilly.com/).  It's a talk by Damian Conway with lots of ideas for extending Vim and using it more productively.

The post on O'Reilly's blog has links to each section of the talk.  There's an amusing part that demonstrates an ASCII art animation inspired by the [Star Wars crawl in Vim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHm36-na4-4#t=0m58s), and you can download this and all the other code here: <http://is.gd/IBV2013>.
