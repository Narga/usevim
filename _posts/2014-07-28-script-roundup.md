###a_pair

[a_pair](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4991) by Colin Cai combines the brackets `{}`, `[]`, and `()` into a text object called `ap`.  That means if you've got sets of nested brackets you can operate on multiple levels at once.

I thought this might be useful if you're working with JSON documents, where you can often find arrays nested inside objects.
