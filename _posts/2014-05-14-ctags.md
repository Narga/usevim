[Supercharge your VIM into an IDE with CTags](http://blog.sensible.io/2014/05/09/supercharge-your-vim-into-ide-with-ctags.html) by sensible.io is a guide to using CTags with Vim:

> CTags generates an index file of all your classes, methods and all other identifiers. You can use that index in your editor to jump straight to the methods you're interested in. In this article, I'll show you how to use them with Vim and Rails.

It's a short tutorial that introduces the basics, like how to generate CTags with the `ctags` command, and how to jump to methods with `:ta`.

If you're new to CTags and use Ruby then this might help you get started.
