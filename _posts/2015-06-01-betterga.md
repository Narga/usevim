[betterga](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5186) (GitHub: [manicmaniac/betterga](https://github.com/manicmaniac/betterga)) by Ryosuke Ito is an extended version of the `:ascii` command.  This command is typically invoked with `ga`, and shows the ASCII value of the character under the cursor in decimal, hexidecimal, and octal.

Ryosuke's version of ga adds some useful extra information, including unicode details.  For example:

* `<a> [LATIN SMALL LETTER A] 97, Hex 0x61, Octal 0141`
* `<®> [REGISTERED SIGN] 174, Hex 0xae, Octal 0256`
* `<∆> [INCREMENT] 8710, Hex 0x2206, Octal 021006`

The template is defined with `g:betterga_template`, so you can change what values get displayed.

If you want even more character representations, then try [tpope/vim-characterize](https://github.com/tpope/vim-characterize) by Tim Pope.  This one returns emoji and HTML entities:

* `<©> 169, \251, U+00A9 COPYRIGHT SIGN, ^KCo, ^KcO, :copyright:, &copy;`

If you take a look at the source for Tim's plugin you'll see large arrays of values for HTML entities and emojis, so it doesn't have any Ruby/Python dependencies but the `autoload/characterize.vim` file is pretty large.
