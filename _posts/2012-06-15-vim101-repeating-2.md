In [Vim 101: Repeating Commands](http://usevim.com/2012/06/01/vim101-repeating-commands/) I covered several ways of repeating a previous command.  These techniques are great ways to speed up mundane editing operations.  In the comments Richard Fabian suggested `;` and `,` as well, which repeat the previously typed left-right motion: `f`, `t`, `F` or `T`.

The left-right motions are seriously worth adding to your permanent muscle memory, so let's recap how they work:

* `f{char}` -- Move to the next `{char}`
* `F{char}` -- Move to the previous `{char}`
* `t{char}` -- Move before the next `{char}`
* `T{char}` -- Move after the previous `{char}`

All of these motions take an argument as well.  After one has been issued, pressing `;` will repeat it in the same direction, while `,` repeats it in the opposite direction.
