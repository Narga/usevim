On reddit there's a post about managing projects in Vim: [How do you load projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/212s8a/how_do_you_load_projects/)

> I recently added a "Project loading" section to my vimrc. I want to load a project in vim quickly. I will cd to the root, run ctags, give custom configurations to a plugin, etc.
> I am currently using a function for each project. A naming convention is used so I can type `:call Load`
> Then tab through the wild menu. I shortcut the the project I'm working on.
> Combined with Tim Pope's Dispatch it really opens up the doors to load smoothly.

I don't use any specific project management plugins.  Instead I use the following tools:

* [autojump](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump) to quickly jump to a project directory
* [vinegar.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar) to browse file systems
* tmux to quickly open a panels for running tests and other commands

It can take a while to get used to vinegar.vim, but the fact it's a very lightweight wrapper around netrw appeals to me.  I also use a shell and git aliases to speed up these commands.

Because IDEs and editors like Sublime and Atom have built-in project management support, then new Vim users often feel like these features are missing.  But I find the autojump/tmux/vinegar.vim combination to work well for most of my work.
