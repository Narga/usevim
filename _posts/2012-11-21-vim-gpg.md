In [Integrating Vim and GPG](http://blogs.operationaldynamics.com/andrew/software/gnome-desktop/vim-gpg-integration) by Andrew Cowie, the author describes a GPG-based workflow for encrypting notes.

He discovered [vim-gnupg](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3645) (GitHub: [jamessan / vim-gnupg](https://github.com/jamessan/vim-gnupg), License: _GPL2_) by James McCoy, which provides a transparent means of editing GPG encrypted text files.  When opening a file with a recognised extension (`.gpg`, `.pgp.`, `.asc`) it'll encrypt and decrypt the file as required.

It works using the `gpg` binary, so you'll need to install that to use it.

I like Andrew's idea of using Vim and GNU Privacy Guard as a handy way of recording sensitive notes.  In a world where there's an app for everything, it's sometimes preferable to rely on our stalwart Unix commands!
