I've just managed to build [VimR](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr) by Tae Won Ha.  It's a Mac version of Vim that started out as an attempt to get the author's earlier [MacVimFramework](http://usevim.com/2014/02/05/mac-framework/) embedded in a real application.

Building it wasn't that hard -- all I had to do in addition to the guide in the readme was `sudo gem install cocoapods`.

One cool feature that VimR adds is a "quickly open" dialog that seems to index files quickly, and you can even search before indexing has finished.

The project [includes tests](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/tree/master/VimRTests), and is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.
