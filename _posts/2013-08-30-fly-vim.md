When you start working at a new job, it takes a while to get used to the house style.  Some companies have dotfiles to get you started, others have... [Maximum Awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome).

In [Fly Vim, First-Class](http://corner.squareup.com/2013/08/fly-vim-first-class.html), Vim enthusiasts at Square discuss this collection of Vim scripts:

> Maximum Awesome comes with many of the features you expect from a full IDE: syntax highlighting, code completion, error highlighting, etc. There are also some components included beyond Vim. Maximum Awesome comes with iTerm 2, a replacement for Terminal, a tmux config, and the Solarized color scheme. This just scratches the surface, though. Hop over to the README for a more exhaustive list.

Another company that is vocal about its love of Vim is [thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com/).  The thoughtbot dotfiles include Vim settings: [thoughtbot / dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).

Although I think it's good that these companies promote Vim, be careful with collections like Maximum Awesome.  It's easy to rely on plugins when a deeper understanding of Vim could result in more longterm productivity.  It's easy to learn a subset of skills that you can get by on rather than a more complete suite of Vim wizardry.
