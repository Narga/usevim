If you find Zsh's shortcuts awkward, then you might be pleased to know it can be switched into vi mode.  It supports vi line editing mode which can be enabled with `bindkey -v`.

Shells that use [Readline](http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) can be set to use vi mode by setting the following in `~/.inputrc`:

{% highlight text %}
set editing-mode vi
set blink-matching-paren on
{% endhighlight %}

Zsh doesn't use Readline, however, so it will check if you want to use vi or Emacs shortcuts based on the `$EDITOR` variable.  You can override the setting with `bindkey -v` for vi or `bindkey -e` for Emacs.

It's worth trying out vi mode just to see how it works -- pressing `<Esc>` allows you to edit and navigate lines just like vi.

While researching this article I found [Adding Vi To Your Zsh](http://dougblack.io/words/zsh-vi-mode.html) by [Doug Black](https://twitter.com/dougblackio), which has a lot of background on vi mode and a script for displaying the current mode.
