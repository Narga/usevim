###neocomplcache

[neocomplcache](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2620) (GitHub: [Shougo / neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache), License: _MIT_) by Shougo Matsushita is a keyword completion plugin.  It supports configurable completion for quick matching, snippets, filenames, and registers.  It also enhances omni completion, and works with [VimShell](https://github.com/Shougo/vimshell).

The author's [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache) has configuration examples and screenshots of each feature.

![fisa-vim-config](/images/posts/fisa-vim-config.png)

[fisa-vim-config](https://github.com/fisadev/fisa-vim-config) (License: _GPL_) is Juan Pedro Fisanotti's `.vimrc` that's focused on Python development and uses Vundle for managing plugins.  It includes smart completion, a fuzzy file finder, class and module browsing -- basically everything to turn Vim into a Python-friendly IDE.

Juan has included documentation that explains the keyboard shortcuts and installation details using Vundle.  There's also a link to each of the bundled scripts.
