###Vim-EPUB

[Vim-EPUB](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5006) (GitHub: [etnadji / vim-epub](https://github.com/etnadji/vim-epub), License: _GPL_) by Etienne Nadji is an eBook editing plugin that makes it easier to work with EPUB files.

For example, `:AddEmptyPage` adds a new page, `:AddEmptyCSS` adds a CSS file, and `:AddMedia` can be used to add image files and fonts.

The `:OpenReader` command opens the resulting document in the system's default EPUB reader.

Etienne has included [some snippets](https://github.com/etnadji/vim-epub/tree/master/snippets) for Dublin Core XML and EPUB, so you can quickly insert blocks of XML for various commonly used tags.
