Recently I somehow ended up with `set clipboard=unnamed` in my `.vimrc`.  I don't remember adding it, but I searched and removed it when I realised changes were overwriting my system clipboard contents.  Here's what `:help unnamed` says, in case you're not familiar with this feature:

> When included, Vim will use the clipboard register '\*'
> for all yank, delete, change and put operations which
> would normally go to the unnamed register.  When a

Some people like `set clipboard=unnamed`.  I find the `"*` register is way too frequently updated -- I prefer to think of the system clipboard as something that exists outside Vim, and keep Vim's registers as a separate bank of snippets.

If you're not sure how to paste from the system clipboard within Vim, then try `"+p`.  I wrote about this in [Vim 101: Registers](http://usevim.com/2012/04/13/registers/), but in general just try to remember that registers are prefixed with a double quote and you can always view them with `:reg`.
