DidYouMean.vim (GitHub: [EinfachToll/DidYouMean](https://github.com/EinfachToll/DidYouMean), License: _MIT_) by Daniel Schemala is a small plugin that prompts for the correct filename instead of opening a new file.  It's ideal if you often type a partial filename, press tab, then accidentally open a new file because multiple filenames matched.

One reason I liked the plugin is the source is relatively easy to follow.  If you're trying to learn Vim script then you might want to look through [DidYouMean.vim](https://github.com/EinfachToll/DidYouMean/blob/master/plugin/DidYouMean.vim) to see how it works.
