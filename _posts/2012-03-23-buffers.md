When I first started using Vim the thing that confused me the most was buffers.  The editors that I used before simply showed windows or tabs for each open file -- if a file wasn't visible it was closed.  Buffers are confusing to beginners because they seem to hang around even when the associated window has been closed.

To understand what buffers are it's important to realise that Vim separates the concept of an open file from how it's displayed.  Buffers are a portion of memory that's been loaded with the contents of a file -- but _not_ the original file.  Nothing happens to the original file until the buffer is written.

Since Vim can display buffers in windows and tabs, then buffers can actually be hidden from view.  That means every file you've opened will remain accessible until you quit Vim, and that also implies opening a file for editing automatically creates a buffer.

### Managing Buffers

I usually type the `:ls` ex command to list buffers, but if you have trouble remembering this start with `:buffers`:

![Vim buffer list](/images/posts/vim101-buffers-list.png)

To make any of these buffers the active buffer, type `:buffer number`, where `number` is the number of the buffer in the list.  The `a` next to the third file here indicates that it's the active buffer.

To open all of the buffers in windows, type `:ball`:

This actually places each buffer in a new window.  They can even be opened in vertical windows using `:vertical ball`.

A specific buffer can be opened in a new window by issuing the `:sbuffer` command.  A shortcut for this is to type a number then press `ctrl w^`.

During the average working day I'll open dozens of files -- doesn't that mean Vim will keep opening buffers until there's an unmanageable amount?  Yes, but fortunately buffers can be deleted by using `:bdelete`.  A file name or buffer number can be supplied as the argument.  A range of buffers can even be deleted: `:10,16bdelete` would delete the buffers from 10 up to and including 16.

### Buffer Navigation

Other than the basic `:ls` and `:buffer` commands, there's `:bnext` and `:bprevious`, which are typically issued with the shortened forms of `:bn` and `:bp`.

### Further Reading

There's a lot more to learn about buffers, but I feel like this should be enough to use Vim effectively without being overwhelmed.  The help text for buffers and windows, available in `:help buffers`, explains everything you could ever want to know about buffers.  The [Vim Buffer FAQ](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_buffer_FAQ) is a relatively concise overview of buffers that's a little bit easier to get to grips with.
