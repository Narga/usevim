Announcing:  Vim (Vi IMproved) version 7.4a BETA 

This is the first BETA release of Vim 7.4. 

Please check that the distribution is OK.  I haven't done one for a long 
time.  Report anything that isn't right.  That includes a crash but also 
a typo in the documentation or a missing file. 

The biggest additions since 7.3: 
- A new, faster regular expression engine. 
- More than a thousand fixes and small improvements. 

Once you have installed Vim 7.4a BETA you can find details about the 
changes since Vim 7.3 with: 
        :help version-7.4 
{% endhighlight %}

Binaries are here:

* [Unix source, runtime files, bzip2](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unstable/unix/vim-7.4a.tar.bz2)
* [Windows executable](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unstable/pc/gvim74a.exe)
