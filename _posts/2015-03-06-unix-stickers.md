Unixstickers has a [new Vim poster](http://www.unixstickers.com/posters/linux-posters/vim-editor-logo-wall-poster) that's a giant Vim logo.  I have a [Vim Unixsticker](http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/software_stickers/vim-text-editor-shaped-sticker), and unlike most of my other Internet-ordered sticker swag this one is vinyl and looks pretty good on a laptop.

If you're looking for a cheatsheet style Vim poster, then [this is my favourite one](http://vimcheatsheet.com).   They're going to a release a 2.0 version soon.
