[Permut](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5078) (GitHub: [jlemetay/permut](https://github.com/jlemetay/permut), License: _Vim_) by JYLM is a plugin for swapping columns in a text-formatted table.  It requires that a common column separator character is used, and the default is `|`.

Permut is invoked with `:[range] Permut col1 col2 [separator]`.

You might find this plugin useful if you write tables Markdown.  I've found Markdown tables can be difficult to manage, so I end up writing tables in another tool then converting them to Markdown later.

The author suggests using [Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular) to align text to fit into columns.
