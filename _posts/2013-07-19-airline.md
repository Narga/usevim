Although [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) is extremely popular (and looks undeniably cool), it does take a bit of effort to install.  It used to be distributed as a Vim plugin, but was superseded by a Python script that many struggled to install.  The advantage of the Python script is it consolidates Powerline-style info bars for several applications: Vim, tmux, screen, and more.  However, there were those that felt it was too laborious to get it set up right: messing around with patched fonts and Python is a barrier to entry.

That's where [vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) comes in.  It is 100% Vim script, small, integrates with other plugins like NERD Tree and fugitive.vim, and still looks good with unpatched fonts.  I think for me that's a big win, because I often find myself using systems that can't even support the patched fonts Powerline works best with.

The author, Bailey Ling, maintains an [airline wiki](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/wiki/FAQ) with useful hints.

And, if you're interested, my own hackish tmux Powerline-inspired settings look like this: [tmux.conf](https://gist.github.com/alexyoung/6040385).  I used some colours and blank spaces to create what I thought was a nice effect, while looking fairly simple still.
