![Vi and Vim Area 51](/images/posts/viarea51.png)

[There was a Vim Stack Exchange experiment](http://usevim.com/2014/09/24/vim-overflow/) last year, and [then it was closed](http://usevim.com/2014/10/10/vim-overflow-2/) despite receiving the necessary community support.  But now it's back!  It's [currently a proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/80441/vi-and-vim?referrer=zvD1X0YStSCNAfGtTTKvSg2), and there are 62 example questions.

There's a [discussion on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2t571i/vivim_stackexchange_needs_you_once_again_area_51/), but for the real truth behind the original proposal's rejection I think we all know [where](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/) to find the answer!

I don't think a vi and Vim Stack Exchange would hurt, any source of Vim information is useful if you're trying to improve your skills.  Hopefully this time the proposal will get enough votes and moderator support.
