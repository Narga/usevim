[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs) (PDF: [sicp.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.S184/sicp.pdf)) is a popular book used as an introduction to computer science.  It uses MIT Scheme, and covers concepts that are now mainstream concerns, like concurrent programming, functional programming, and lazy evaluation.

In [Configuring Vim for SICP](http://crash.net.nz/posts/2014/08/configuring-vim-for-sicp/), the author explains how to set up Vim and tmux for following along with the book.  [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) is recommended as the Scheme interpreter, because the REPL is more friendly than MIT Scheme.  There's also a [third-party package](http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=sicp.plt&owner=neil) to support people reading SICP.

Steve Losh's [tslime.vim](https://github.com/sjl/tslime.vim) fork is recommended for quickly evaluating code by passing it from Vim to tmux and the Scheme interpreter.

When I read SICP a few years ago I used [MIT Scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) with [rlwrap](http://freecode.com/projects/rlwrap), so you can try that if you have issues installing Racket.  Another option is [SICP in Clojure](http://sicpinclojure.com/), which would work well with [fireplace.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace).  It's still being worked on, and there's a lot of comment spam, but I've always found Clojure a very accessible Lisp dialect.
