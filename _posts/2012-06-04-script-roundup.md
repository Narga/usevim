###Vitra

[Vitra](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4092) (GitHub: [nsmgr8 / vitra](https://github.com/nsmgr8/vitra), License: _MIT_) by M. Nasimul Haque is a [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) interface for Vim.  It communicates with a Trac server using XML-RPC, and displays wiki pages and tickets in an elaborate Vim-based interface.

Typing `:TTOpen` will open the ticket UI, which displays a list of tickets and full details on the selected ticket.  If your project has a lot of tickets, the list can be paginated through, sorted, ordered, and filtered.  Tickets can also be created and updated.  The wiki interface has similar options.

###cowsay.vim

[cowsay.vim](https://github.com/mklabs/vim-cowsay) (License: _Vim_) is a wrapper for [cowsay](http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml) that can be combined with [TComment](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1173) to litter your code with comical cows.
