Drew Neil, author of [Practical Vim](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim), has published a set of learning materials for Vim called the [Core Vim Course](http://vimcasts.org/training/core-vim-course/).  It includes 10 videos, 16 exercises, PDFs, and transcripts for each video.

The course costs $120, which is cheaper than a workshop, plus you can follow along at your own speed.  The videos don't have DRM, so you could download them and work offline -- I usually do courses like this on the train because that's the only chance I get!

There's also a $255 "online" option which allows you to get a four hour live tutorial and a realtime question and answer session.

Drew is [still running private classes](http://vimcasts.org/training/private/), and you can contact him about purchasing multi-user licenses for your company.
