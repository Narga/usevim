[How to boost your Vim productivity](http://sheerun.net/2014/03/21/how-to-boost-your-vim-productivity/) by Adam Stankiewicz has some thoughtful tips about improving the way you use Vim.  The first tip is about changing `Leader` to the space bar, which Adam says means he can keep his fingers on the home row because space is easy to hit with both thumbs.

Other tips include some useful plugins for manipulating visual selections, tmux, and more remapping techniques.

It was published back in March, so there are some useful comments as well.
