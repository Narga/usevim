Vim supports several dynamic languages for scripting, including Python and Ruby.  With the release of [Ruby 2](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/), interest in using the latest stable version of Ruby with Vim will start to pick up steam over the coming months.  Kohei Suzuki noticed that Vim wouldn't compile with `--enable-rubyinterp=dynamic` on 64bit platforms with Ruby 2.0.0, so he submitted a patch to the vim_dev group: [ruby-dyn-2.0.0.patch](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/P8l30hk9hyE/GFSinV_gHWAJ).

The patch is fairly short, adding some preprocessor macros for numerical functions.  Bram Moolenaar responded so presumably this patch will appear in [Vim's source](https://code.google.com/p/vim/source/list) soon.
