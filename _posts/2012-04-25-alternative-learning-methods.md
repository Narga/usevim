Vim has excellent documentation, and the interactive `vimtutor` isn't bad either.  However, I don't blame anyone who seeks alternative ways to learn Vim.

Over the last few years several web applications have appeared that aim to demystify Vim.  One of the most popular is [Open Vim's tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html), which is a web-based simulation of Vim that aims to teach everything from basic movement to visual block mode.

There's also the sterling [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/), which currently features 35 screencasts on Vim and popular plugins.  It's produced by [Drew Neil](http://drewneil.com/) who also has some Vim-related stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/nelstrom/).

If tutorials and screencasts don't appeal to you, then how about some Vim games?  There's the [hjkl maze game](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3409) by Ran Bi, which is a useful tool for practicing the `hjkl` movement keys.

Another game is [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) by Doron Linder.  It currently has a limited number of levels, but promises to include more in the future through a registration system:

> Additional levels are currently being developed for you to play and enjoy. The 3rd level will be available for FREE only for players who sign up for my email list.

I played through it and actually found it quite enjoyable, although I could do without the sound effects.

My advice for novices is always the same: use Vim regularly, and learn a little bit at a time.
