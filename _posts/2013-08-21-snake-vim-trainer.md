[Snake Vim Trainer](http://www.vimsnake.com/) (GitHub: [patmood / vim_snake](https://github.com/patmood/vim_snake)) by Patrick Moody is cool for three reasons:

1. It's open source
2. It can help you learn `hjkl`
3. It's a game!

It's basically snake, with the twist that you must press `i` to eat, and `<Esc>` to move again.

If you're used to the keys it's not _too_ difficult to get 1000 points, but after that it gets tricky.  There's something about my brain that doesn't like the position of `i` relative to `hjkl` in this setting, although I've never noticed the issue before in Vim.
