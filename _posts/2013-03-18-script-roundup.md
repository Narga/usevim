###vim-scroll-position

[vim-scroll-position](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4476) (GitHub: [junegunn / vim-scroll-position](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-scroll-position)) by Junegunn Choi is another plugin that uses Vim's sign feature (`:help :sign-intro`).  This one displays the relative position of the cursor, and indicates the latest jump and change positions.

###interactive-replace

[interactive-replace](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4474) (GitHub: [hwrod / interactive-replace](https://github.com/hwrod/interactive-replace), License: _MIT_) by Harold Rodriguez adds a new command, `:InteractiveReplace`, which can be used to interactively substitute search matches.

Harold's documentation includes an example where variables are substituted for various values that stem from a `.`.
