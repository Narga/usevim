There's limitless variation for a Vim and shell-based workflow.  I like to stay in Vim most of the time, switching to other windows for command-line tools with tmux.  In my office I've noticed a seasoned Vim veteran using Vim and then backgrounding it to run shell commands.  He'll switch back when he needs Vim.

This style has its advantages -- you could use shells inside Vim, but that's perhaps only useful if you want to get results into Vim easily.  Also, pressing `CTRL-Z` to suspend Vim requires less key presses than the `CTRL-A n` or `CTRL-A hjkl` I press for navigating between tmux windows and panels.

Typing `fg` in most shells will bring a backgrounded process to the foreground.  If you're running Vim and press `CTRL-Z`, you're actually causing the `SIGSTOP` signal to be sent to the process.  The `fg` command is built into your shell, so each shell has its own quirks.

In Zsh, `fg` supports autocomplete.  You can have multiple suspended versions of Vim and switch between them using `fg [tab]`, which displays a menu for each instance:

{% highlight text %}
$ fg %vim
%1  -- vim
%2  -- vim test.js
{% endhighlight %}

I don't usually do this because I like to use a single instance of Vim with windows and tabs, but you might like it if you want to use an instance of Vim per project.
