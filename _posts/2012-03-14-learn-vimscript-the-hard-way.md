Last week in [Introduction to Syntax Highlighting](http://usevim.com/2012/03/07/syntax-highlighting/) I touched on a little bit of VimL.  There's an excellent freely available resource for learning more about Vim's scripting language in the form of [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/) by Steve Losh.

The book itself is on GitHub at [sjl / learnvimscriptthehardway](https://github.com/sjl/learnvimscriptthehardway/), and on Leanpub here: [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://leanpub.com/learnvimscriptthehardway).

_Learn Vimscript the Hard Way_ is aimed at intermediate Vim users -- you should be familiar with major concepts like buffers, windows, text objects, and pretty much everything in `vimtutor`.

Each chapter introduces a concept and then includes exercises for practice, inspired by Zed Shaw's [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/).  The [case studies](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/32.html) in particular demonstrate not just how to write scripts, but how to think about writing complex Vimscript.

Even if you're not interested in writing Vim plugins, I'd recommend reading _Learn Vimscript the Hard Way_ or at least having a flick through the first edition when it's finished.  It'll give you the tools you need to really customise Vim without getting stuck in search engine hell.
