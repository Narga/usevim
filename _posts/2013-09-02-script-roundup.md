###Ultimate Colorscheme

It can be hard to find just the right colour scheme, and Vim doesn't exactly make it easy to quickly switch between them.  [Ultimate Colorscheme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4679) (GitHub: [biskark / vim-ultimate-colorscheme-utility](https://github.com/biskark/vim-ultimate-colorscheme-utility), License: _MIT_) by Kevin Biskar allows you to browse your colour schemes, and favourite them.  Favourites can be associated with filetypes, so you could use different schemes based on programming language.

###clever-f.vim

[clever-f.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4707) (GitHub: [rhysd / clever-f.vim](https://github.com/rhysd/clever-f.vim), License: _MIT_) by Linda Rhysd is a variation on `fFtT` that makes it easier to repeat the previous command:

> clever-f.vim extends `f` mapping for more convenience. You may be able to forget the existence of `;`. And you can use `;` for another mapping.
