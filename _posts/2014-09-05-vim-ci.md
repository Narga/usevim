With all the Vim forks and reinventions of Vim, I thought readers might find it interesting to learn about [vim-ci](https://github.com/vim-jp/vim-ci), created by the vim-jp community.

This repository includes a fork of Vim as a submodule and includes a build script so a continuous integration server like Travis can easily handle the output.  The build script triggers `./configure` with `make && make test` so it's easy to run the tests.

I found this through [a thread on vim dev](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/V5NxRJI_oOY/VBdUY3OU_AYJ) where Marslo Jiao was asking about how to adapt Vim to help maintain a Windows Vim build.
