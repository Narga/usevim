[HappyEdit](http://www.indiegogo.com/happyedit) is a proposed project to remake Vim using modern web technologies.  The project was started by Per Thulin who previously worked at [Flattr](https://flattr.com/).  Per is looking for $10,000 funding to develop the application, but already has an initial version which is demonstrated in the Indiegogo video.

In terms of a crowdsourced project, the perks aren't particularly exciting.  The most interesting aspect of HappyEdit is Per's user interface ideas -- rather than slavishly duplicating Vim he's trying to do new things with the web-based GUI.

The current version is based on [Ace](http://ace.ajax.org/), which is also used as a basis for [Cloud9](https://c9.io/).  Per's initial version of HappyEdit can be downloaded from GitHub here: [pthulin / HappyEdit](https://github.com/pthulin/HappyEdit).

I've previously written about [Cloud Vi](http://usevim.com/2012/06/27/cloudvi/), which is a mashup of [jsvi](http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/) and [Filepicker.io](https://www.filepicker.io/).  Although I'm a terminal fanatic, I still find these web-based editors interesting, so send them in for review.
