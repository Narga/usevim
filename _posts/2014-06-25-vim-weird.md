I recently read [Vim for people who think things like Vim are weird and hard](http://csswizardry.com/2014/06/vim-for-people-who-think-things-like-vim-are-weird-and-hard/) by Harry Roberts, a post that attempts to explain why Vim is worth learning:

> I'd watch friends using Vim and be perplexed as to why you'd possibly ever need to type `<Esc>ggdG` to delete the entire contents of a file. How on earth can something so bizarre do that? How on earth do you remember that? In what world does that even make sense?!
> 
> In fact, the `<Esc>ggdG` example is a great demonstration of misconceptions and misinformation in Vim world. The command to delete the entire contents of a file is simply `dG`: `d`elete and `G`o to the bottom of the file. What `<Esc>ggdG` actually does is:
> 
> * `<Esc>` ensures you're in the correct mode.
> * `gg` moves your cursor to the top of the file.
> * `d` tells Vim to prepare to delete.
> * `G` tells Vim to go to the bottom of the file (whilst deleting, as per the previous command).

I love breaking commands down into mnemonics like this, because it does show that with a little bit of effort you can make editing composable rather than tedious.
