Toyama Satoshi has created a [vim-swift](https://github.com/toyamarinyon/vim-swift) project that adds support for Swift's syntax highlighting and indentation.

[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) is Apple's new programming language that is REPL friendly and has some innovative "playground" features in the new Xcode.

Even though it's currently a small project, vim-swift has some nice touches: each part of the plugin is cleanly separated, and there are test `.swift` files that could probably be tied in to automated testing.
