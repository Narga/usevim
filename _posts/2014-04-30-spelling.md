  <small>Replacing text with <code>z=</code>.</small>
</div>

You probably already know that you can enable spell checking in Vim with `:set spell`.  This is great for drafting up blog posts, particularly if you write in a lightweight format like Markdown.  If you type `:help 'spell'` you'll see some other options, like `'spelllang'` and `'spellsuggest'`.  Vim actually has quite a few options for tailoring the behaviour of the spell checker, but I usually find it works fine out of the box.

Something new to me that I learned recently is `z=`.  Typing `z=` shows a menu of words that are similar to the text under the cursor.  You can press a number to quickly select one of the words, so if it's an obvious mistake you may even be able to type `z=1`.

The `:spellr` command repeats the previous replacement for all matches in the current window.  I've done this where I've pasted text with a consistent error.

I write almost everything in Vim, so I've been mining `:help spell` more and more.
