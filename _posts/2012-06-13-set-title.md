Vim's `statusline` is often used to display the name of the currently edited file.  Another way to do this is by setting a `titlestring`:

{% highlight viml %}
" enable setting title
set title
" configure title to look like: Vim /path/to/file
set titlestring=VIM:\ %-25.55F\ %a%r%m titlelen=70
{% endhighlight %}

This example is from [Josh Nichols' .vimrc](https://github.com/technicalpickles/pickled-vim/blob/master/home/.vimrc#L79).

The `title` setting is off by default, so your terminal's title will be whatever the shell set it to.  The reason I like setting it to the current filename is my `statusline` displays quite a lot already, so there often isn't space to display enough of the path of the file I'm editing.

Console Vim changes the terminal's title by using suitable escape sequences, and this should also work in the Windows console.

The `titlestring` setting can use printf-style interpolation, and the expansion works the same way as `statusline`.  Type `:help 'statusline'` to see all of the options.

In the example above, the following items have been used:

* `F` -- Full path to the file in the buffer
* `a` -- Argument list status
* `r` -- Readonly flag
* `m` -- Modified flag
