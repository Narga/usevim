[Vim SuperMan](https://github.com/Z1MM32M4N/vim-superman) by Jake Zimmerman is a Vim plugin that allows you to read `man` pages with Vim instead of the default pager.  You'll have to add a function to your shell's settings to make it work -- follow the example in the readme to make `vman command` work.

I tried it out and I thought it worked well.  I prefer being able to search and navigate the text using the Vim commands, and the syntax highlight for man pages looks great.

Jake wrote a blog post with more details about the project: [Vim as a Man Page Viewer](http://blog.zimmerman.io/2014/12/20/vim-as-a-man-page-viewer/).  I noticed he posted it to Hacker News as well: [Show HN: Vim SuperMan](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8781621).
