Reading through public dotfiles is one of the ways that I research articles for _usevim_, and also how I learn new Vim techniques.  However, one thing that I find surprisingly lacking is operator-pending mappings (`:help omap-info`).  To understand this cryptic term, you need to revisit operators and motions.

After typing an operator command, Vim will wait for a motion.  For example, typing `yw` when in Normal mode will yank the word under the cursor: `y` is the operator command and `w` is the motion.  The operator is said to be pending in the time between typing the operator command and the motion.

Operator-pending mappings can be used to map characters during this time.

If I was replacing a lot of text inside HTML tags, I could map the `it` text object to `t`:

{% highlight vim %}
:omap t it
{% endhighlight %}

Now typing `dt` will delete the text between an opening and closing tag.  Also, `yt` will yank it and `ct` will remove it and start editing.

Although we're used to thinking about the Normal, Visual, and Command-line modes, Operator-pending mode (`:help Operator-pending-mode`) is also considered a mode.  Granted, it's a variant on Normal mode, but it is a specific state that's addressable by mappings.
