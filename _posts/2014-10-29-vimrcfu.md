Florian Beer sent in [vimrcfu](http://vimrcfu.com/), a site for sharing Vim configuration snippets.  You can up and down-vote each snippet, and share new ones by signing in with GitHub.

Florian said he created the site as a way to learn more Vim.  He's looking for snippets, so please help him by adding some of your favourites!
