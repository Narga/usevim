Here's a debate with no right answer: should you use default keybindings or highly customised ones that you prefer? I have tmux set up to use vi-like keybindings, and I have a few vi-inspired tweaks for zsh as well.  Now whenever I switch to a colleague's machine that uses tmux I struggle for a few minutes to get used to the standard shortcuts.

If, like me, you like to customise everything, then you might be interested [new oh-my-zsh vi-mode changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/30hx2d/oh_my_zsh_vimode_plugin_need_some_testers/).  There are [pull requests](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pulls?utf8=✓&q=vi-mode) for these changes on GitHub, in case you want to help test.

I've summarised the recent changes below:

* [#3616](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3616): Added standard `ctrl-r` for incremental history searching, `G` `gg` `u` `^-R` Vim commands behavior, X clipboard interaction with standard Vim commands (y/p/d/c)
* [#3290](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3290): prompt function in vi-mode plugin
* [#3547](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3547): Added trapwinch to vi-mode plugin (merged)
* [#3603](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/3603): ctrl-p, ctrl-n: explore history, ctrl-h, ctrl-?, ctrl-w: char, word deletion (merged)

Daniel Campoverde Carrión (alx741) describes the zsh vi-mode as limited, and I'd agree with that, so I'm looking forward to using these new vi-mode plugin features.
