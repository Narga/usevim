Yesterday Tim Pope published a new plugin called [dotenv.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5176) (GitHub: [tpope/vim-dotenv](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dotenv), License: _Vim_).  It reads variables from a `.env` or `Procfile` and sets the corresponding variables in Vim.

This is useful if you have Procfiles for web applications and want to trigger the same commands for local development.  Tim notes that you can use dotenv.vim  with [projectionist.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist) and [dispatch.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) to get a default `:Start` of `foreman start` for projects with a Procfile, which is ideal if you're working on lots of Heroku projects.
