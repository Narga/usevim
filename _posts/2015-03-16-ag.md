![Vim Ags](/images/posts/ags.png)

There's a new [Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) plugin (GitHub: [gabesoft/vim-ags](https://github.com/gabesoft/vim-ags)) by Gabriel Adomnicai that aims to improve search result navigation.  The basic usage is `:Ags`, and it also has `:AgsAdd` for adding matches to the current set of search results.

Once you're in a search result window you can use some mappings for navigation.  Pressing `p` navigates file paths forward, `a` displays the file path for the current results, and `c` copies the current path to the clipboard.  There are also commands for opening a file above the results window (`oa`), and opening to the left (`ol`).  There are many more mappings: press `u` to see them or view the [full documentation](https://github.com/gabesoft/vim-ags/blob/master/doc/ags.txt).

The search results group the matches under the filenames, so the results are a little less noisy than the other search plugins that I've used.  The author describes it as alpha right now, but I've tried switching to it for a few days because I prefer the search result view.
