Tyler Benziger sent in Selecta (GitHub: [garybernhardt/selecta](https://github.com/garybernhardt/selecta), License: _MIT_) by Gary Bernhardt.  It's a fuzzy file finder that also works with command names, help topics, identifiers, or anything else that has a list.

It's designed to be used with Vim, but you could use it with other programs as well.  Given a list of items in `stdin`, it'll present a fuzzy selection interface.  The subsequent selection will be printed on `stdout`.

Gary's basic example is `cat $(ls *.txt | selecta)`, which illustrates how it works quite nicely.  The readme has a short Vim script that you can add to your `.vimrc` if you like the project.

Tyler notes that there's a Vim plugin at [michaelavila/selecta.vim](https://github.com/michaelavila/selecta.vim).  This plugin includes some shortcuts for selecting from a list of files (based on `find . -type f`) and selecting from Vim's buffers.
