###excel.vim

[excel.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4830) (GitHub: [yakiang / excel.vim](https://github.com/yakiang/excel.vim), License: _MIT_) by Yakiang Zhong is a Python-based script that can display the data from an Excel file.  You can install the necessary Python module with `pip install xlrd`, and it will display each worksheet as a separate tab which is cool.

I'm one of those people that opens everything in Vim, so I quite like the idea of this plugin.

###ExtractLinks

[ExtractLinks](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4870) by Ingo Karkat helps manage long links in arbitrary text snippets.  If you're writing a Markdown file, or a comment for a post on a site like Stack Overflow, then `:ExtractLinks` can help manage lists of references to keep the text tidy.

Ingo notes that this plugin was inspired by [Links to references in Mutt or Vim](https://superuser.com/questions/717946/links-to-references-in-mutt-or-vim) on Super User, and I can imagine it being really useful for writing text emails.
