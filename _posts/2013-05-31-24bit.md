If you've been following the recent Vim updates posted to [vim_dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vim_dev), then you may be interested in ZyX's work on supporting 24-bit colours in Vim:

> There is ISO-8613-3 standard for 24-bit color in terminals: \e[38;2;{R};{G};{B}m (foreground, 48 for background) ({R},{G},{B} are decimal integers from 0 to 255). Currently it is fully supported only* by konsole and partially** in xterm. On Windows there is support for this in ConEmu. I am working on supporting this in vim (it will use guifg/guibg attributes in terminal). [Working version](https://bitbucket.org/ZyX_I/vim), bookmark 24-bit-xterm. Does not work if you try to compile with gui support enabled.

This was posted to [the Powerline issue list](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/issues/81).  Kim SilkebÃ¦kken (Lokaltog) said he's already using Konsole and accepted the Powerline patch.  ZyX also posted about using 24-bit colours in tmux:

> Currently you can use tmux_escape option as a workaround if you want true color in shell run under tmux. No true color in tmux statusline though.
