Most IDEs have a graphical drawer that displays a list of files and folders in a project.  Although this is a slow way to navigate between files (hunting for a file visually rather than searching), it provides a useful representation of the project.

The Unix `tree` program is a command-line friendly alternative.  It recursively lists files and directories, supports colourised output, and is available as a package on most systems.

I find `tree` a useful tool for visualising a project, but what about navigating between files using Vim?  There are popular IDE-like file browser plugins, including [NERDTree, vtreeexplorer, and project](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_Vim_like_an_IDE#Project.2FFiletree_Browsing).  NERDTree in particular offers a familiar interface that's easy to use even for Vim beginners.

However, visualising a project's structure and finding files isn't the end of the story.  IDEs and editors also need to show us what we're editing, and where we are in the file.

Vim's [statusline](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'statusline') can show the current file, column and line number, and filesystem information.  Rather than spending a lot of time tweaking the `statusline` setting, a plugin can be used instead.  I like using Kim Silkeb√¶kken's [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) which not only looks cool but also works well with Git.

That isn't to say other options aren't available -- the beauty of Vim is that it can be easily customised to provide the level of navigational context and project visualisation that you require.
