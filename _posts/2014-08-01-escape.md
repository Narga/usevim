One of my colleagues asked me about whether `jk` is a good mapping for escape.  I've always used `<Esc>` for leaving Insert mode, but I don't think it's unreasonable to want to use a key combination that's easier to press.

If you want to try `jk`, then you need to `imap` it:

{% highlight text %}
:imap jk &lt;Esc&gt;
{% endhighlight %}

[Avoid the escape key](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key) on the Vim Wiki has lots more examples, including `<Space>` for _entering_ Insert mode.

Does anyone out there use any alternatives?
