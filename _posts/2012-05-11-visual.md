<strong>Hint:</strong> To make your Vim look the same as my screenshots, download <a href="https://gist.github.com/e5d5ce6488ed066a657d">usevim-vimrc</a> and run Vim with <code>vim -u usevim-vimrc</code>.

In a typical GUI editor, a block of text can be selected by clicking the mouse and dragging over a number of lines or characters.  Vim introduced _Visual mode_ which allows us to reuse the motion commands and operators that we've learned to manipulate blocks of text.

When in Normal mode, press `v` to start making a selection.  The arrow keys or good ol' `hjkl` can be used to make a selection:

If you make a mistake during highlighting, pressing `<Esc>` will stop it and return to Normal mode.

Typing `gv` will switch back into Visual mode with the last selection.  This is incredibly useful when another operation needs to be applied to the previous selection.  Prefixing `v` with a number will reselect the last selection, but will multiply the length of the selection by the number.  In the example below I've made a selection, pressed `<Esc>`, then typed `3v`:

![Visual mode with numbers](/images/posts/vim101-selection.gif)

While making a selection, pressing `o` will go to the other end of the visual selection.  I find myself using this a lot when I need to quickly make a small change to a selection:

All of the motion commands you're familiar with will work as well.  For example, pressing `w` will select words, pressing `9k` will select nine lines up from the current cursor positions.

###Operating on Selections

As we saw in [Vim 101: Registers](http://usevim.com/2012/04/13/registers/), yanking blocks of text from Visual mode is extremely useful.  However, there's more!  Once a selection has been made, there are several operators that can be applied.  For example, pressing `~` will switch the line's case, and `!` can be used to filter the selection through an external command.

I find myself typing `<` and `>` all the time -- these shift the text left or right, which is great for correcting code indentation.

Another important thing to master is pressing `:` to enter Ex commands.  Making a selection with `v` then pressing `:` and entering a regular expression is a good way to limit the effects of a regular expression to a block of text.

To read about all of the operators and commands that can be applied to blocks, take a look at `:help visual-operators`.
