![Flat Vim icons](/images/posts/flat-vim.png)

When you've carefully curated your desktop wallpaper, terminal colours, and system icons, it's a little bit annoying when one of your icons stands out.  So if your gVim or MacVim icon looks too retro, then just switch to terminal Vim for everything!

Or, try one of these new flat icon designs:

* [Flat Vim](http://iconverticons.com/icons/92d8febce1d7a304/)
* [Solarized Vim icon by Kootle](http://i.imgur.com/C37yO9P.png) (source: [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/2bishy/flat_vim_icon_with_solarized_colours/))

I think both of these icons look great, so give them a try if you're tired of the [stalwart logo](http://www.vim.org/logos.php).
