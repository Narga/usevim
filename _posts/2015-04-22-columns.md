Sometimes you just can't get Excel to do what you want.  Given a CSV file and some careful Visual mode blockwise editing, Vim is actually pretty good for editing columns of values.

I had columns of URLs that were separated by tabs that I wanted to edit with Visual-block mode, but I also wanted to wrap each line in quotes and brackets to make a JSON document.  This is what the file looked like:

![Columns](/images/posts/columns-tabs.png?v=1)

When dealing with structured data with varying column lengths, I like to pad the whitespace so the columns line up.  Then I strip out the whitespace at the end.  To do this in Vim, expand the tab size:

```
:set tabstop=80
```

This changes the number of spaces a tab stands for.  Now that everything appears to line up, convert the tabs to spaces:

```
:retab
```

Retab replaces tabs with strings of spaces.

At this point I made my edits and tweaks, with Normal mode and Visual-block.  In the end I wanted to collapse the large amount of white space into a single space, so I did this:

```
`%s/[^ ]\zs  \+/ /g`
```

I've found myself using `tabstop` and `retab` quite often when I've got CSV data that Excel just won't process the way I want.
