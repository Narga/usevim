I spoke at [Vim London](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-London/) last night about Vim and the web.  The slides are here: [Vim and the Web](https://speakerdeck.com/aryoung/vim-and-the-web), and the [Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2014/vimlondon/scwggq/) has more resources and coverage.

I've spent some time with Chromebooks over the last year, trying to use web-based editors.  Some attempt to emulate Vim, which is never quite 100%.  Recently the [Vim.js](http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/web/vim.html) project caught my attention -- it uses Emscripten to build a JavaScript version of Vim that has asm.js optimisations.  I cover this briefly in the talk.
