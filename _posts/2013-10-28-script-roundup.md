###mlessnau\_block\_shift

[mlessnau\_block\_shift](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4754) is a small but well-formed plugin for selecting blocks of text and shifting the block up or down.

When in Visual mode, pressing `<C-K>` will move the selection up, and `<C-j>` will move it down.  The corresponding functions are `BlockShiftUp` and `BlockShiftDown`, so you can rebind them if needed.

###JavaScript Context Coloring

[JavaScript Context Coloring](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4748) (GitHub: [bigfish / vim-js-context-coloring](https://github.com/bigfish/vim-js-context-coloring), License: _MIT_) is a plugin for JavaScript development.  It requires Node, and colourises buffers based on scope.

The author, David Wilhelm, notes that the plugin was inspired by [a 2012 talk by Douglas Crockford](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM) called Monads and Gonads.
