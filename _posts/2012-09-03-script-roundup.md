###vim-librarian.vim

[vim-librarian.vim](https://github.com/malkomalko/vim-librarian.vim) by Robert Malko is a fork of Andrew Radev's [simple_bookmarks.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/simple_bookmarks.vim) that allows sets of bookmarks to be restored.  Like the original version, the core feature is named bookmark management, but the commands are now prefixed with `VL` to keep it separate.

###VOoM

[VOoM](http://vim-voom.github.com/) (vim.org: [VOoM](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2657)) by Vlad Irnov emulates a two-pane text outliner.  It can work with fold markers with level numbers, but it can also handle various markup formats, including Markdown and [vimoutliner](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3515).

Typing `:Voom` will create an outline of the current buffer, and the results will be displayed in a separate window.
