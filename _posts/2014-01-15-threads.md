There's a [fork of Vim that supports threads](https://github.com/tarruda/vim/tree/event-loop) ([Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7057051), [Google Groups post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/65jjGqS1_VQ)), written by Thiago Arruda.  Thiago's approach is to have a thread that captures user input events using a queue, which can then be processed when the main thread is free.

Sometimes Vim appears to lock up: I notice this when I launch The Silver Searcher.  It's clear that an external process is being launched, so I just wait until it's done.  A multithreaded approach could theoretically get around this: plugins and external programs could be launched while Vim continues to accept user input.

If you read through the [vim_dev discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/65jjGqS1_VQ) it quickly becomes clear that this is not a trivial problem.  However, the fork has generated a lot of enthusiasm from the community, so it'll be interesting to see where this goes.
