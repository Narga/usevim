You're happily using Vim, slowly mastering file navigation, split windows and tabs, search and replace, and then you discover a hot new .vimrc on Hacker News that includes lots of commands like this:

{% highlight viml %}
noremap &lt;Leader&gt;W :w !sudo tee % &gt; /dev/null<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

What the devil is `<Leader>`?  Well, in this example it simply means typing `\W` (backslash then w) in Normal mode will save the current file using the `sudo` command.  Does that mean `<Leader>` means backslash?  Well, not quite.  The `<Leader>` key is a reference to a specific key defined by the `mapleader` variable.  A lot of people change to comma because they find it easier to type:

{% highlight viml %}
let mapleader=","
{% endhighlight %}

The `mapleader` variable is easy to change, and if you always remember to map keys with `<Leader>` then you'll avoid confusing your own customisation with Vim's default keyboard shortcuts.

The beauty of the `<Leader>` key is it effectively gives us a namespace for customised keyboard shortcuts.  You don't need to worry about treading on Vim's toes when you set a keyboard shortcut using `<Leader>`.

Vim waits for 1000 milliseconds after the `<Leader>` key has been pressed, so if you take too long to press the next key in the sequence it won't be matched.  This timeout can be changed by using `:set timeoutlen` to set specific value.
