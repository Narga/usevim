[It turns out](http://usevim.com/2013/05/15/vim74/) Vim _did_ reach version 7.3.999, and then 7.3.1000 and beyond:

* [7.3.999](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/EMBEcl4U1j0/euYZePnErPAJ) - New regexp engine sets curbuf temporarily, use reg_buf instead, like the old engine
* [7.3.1000](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/3pneQXQ2GAo/Zlrw51gUf7wJ) - Typo in char value causes out of bounds access, fix character value
* [7.3.1001](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/ImIrTS-EvZI/WB9DdOVtdewJ) - Duplicate condition in if, remove one condition
* [7.3.1002](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/apQaDqafdDY/NhXttax8TxcJ) - Valgrind errors for Python interface, fix memory leaks when running tests
* [7.3.1003](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/M8zGia4wBy4/JRltJEPI7l8J) - Python interface does not compile with Python 2.2
* [7.3.1004](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/TiDkjxXF5bY/kXNsn2bM7SwJ) - No error when option could not be set, report an error

These patches pertain to the promised regular expression and Python interface improvements, so work is definitely culminating towards 7.4.  The [Vim Announce](http://www.vim.org/maillist.php) list will be updated when the next release is ready, although it can be interesting to follow the incremental patches on the `vim_dev` list.
