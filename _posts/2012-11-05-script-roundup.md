###eunuch.vim

The wittily-named [eunuch.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4300) (GitHub: [tpope / vim-eunuch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-eunuch), License: _Vim_) by Tim Pope just reached version 1.0.  It provides a set of wrappers around Unix commands to optimise them for a Vim-oriented workflow.  For example: `:Chmod` changes the permissions on the current file, and `:SudoWrite` will write a file using `sudo`.

###mozilla.vim

[mozilla.vim](https://github.com/mozfr/mozilla.vim) is a collection of scripts related to working on Mozilla's various projects, put together by Fabien Cazenave.  It includes C++ additions for Gecko components and macros, an updated syntax file with CSS3 and HTML5 support, and the author is currently looking for a JavaScript syntax file and other tools for working with ES6 and the latest DOM APIs.
