If you consider yourself a bit of a polyglot, then managing lots of syntax files can get annoying.  For example, I have plugins for CoffeeScript, Markdown, [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), CSS pre-preprocessors, and Clojure.  I think this situation is pretty common for web developers who use Vim.  Even though Vim has some pretty sensible built-in syntax files, languages change pretty quickly.

I recently found [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) by Adam Stankiewicz which bundles over 50 "language packs" together.  It has all of the ones I wanted, and more I didn't even know about.

The author claims it has some advantages over installing separate plugins:

> - It **won't affect your startup time**, as scripts are loaded only on demand\*. 
> - It **installs 50+ times faster** than 50+ packages it consist of.
> - Solid syntax and indentation support. Only the best language packs.
> - All unnecessary files are ignored (like enormous documentation from php support).
> - No support for esoteric languages, only most popular ones (modern too, like `slim`).
> - Each build is tested by automated vimrunner script on CI. See `spec` directory.

I think the fact that each build is tested is pretty cool!
