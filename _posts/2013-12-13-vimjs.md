When I heard about [Vim.js](http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/web/vim.html), I thought it was another plugin collection for working with JavaScript in Vim.  But it turns out it's a pretty interesting [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) port of Vim to browsers.  It uses other JavaScript-related technology as well, like Node, and the author is currently looking for help if you're interested in that sort of thing.

I wrote a slightly more detailed analysis about it at [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com/2013/12/13/vimjs/).
