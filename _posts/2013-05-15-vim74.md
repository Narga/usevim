In a somewhat lighthearted announcement on [vim_announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vim_announce), Bram Moolenaar announced [Vim 7.4](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vim_announce/ZWWgK9aXQ2Y/IMObY8lBFm0J):

> We are now at patch level 7.3.931. In a few weeks we would reach 999.  I don't want to find out what happens if we go over that, so it's time for Vim 7.4!

Bram's post addresses the likelihood of implementing the [top 5 voted features](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/vote_results.php).  Voting for Vim features requires [sponsoring Vim development](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php).

Vim 7.4 is exciting, but if you're interested in the underlying current of patches that are regularly contributed, take a look at [vim_dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vim_dev).  You'll see a flood of activity in response to the Python integration comment in the 7.4 announcement.
