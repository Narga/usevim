Reader Sri Kadimisetty wrote in to ask for a guide to [Unite](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3396) (GitHub: [Shougo / unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim), License: _MOT_) by Matsu Shougo.  It has been compared to [FuzzyFinder](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984) and [ctrlp.vim](http://kien.github.io/ctrlp.vim/), but it's actually quite different, which is partly why people seem to find it confusing.

In this article I introduce Unite, with the goal of demystifying its main features.

###What is Unite?

Unite is for quickly navigating between files in a project.  It isn't limited to files -- other lists of things can be displayed and searched as well.  This open-ended nature is probably what people find confusing about it.

Unite isn't limited to searching files or buffers -- it can comfortably handle both, and more.  An API is provided so other Vim plugin authors can extend it to support other data sources.

###Usage

Unite's commands take the format `:Unite source`, where "source" is one of `buffer`, `file`, and `file_rec`.

* `buffer`: Browse a list of the currently opened buffers
* `file`: Browse the list of files in the current directory
* `file_rec`: Recursively list files under the current directory

Once a command has been issued, a new horizontally split window will open.  For example, `:Unite file` will show a list of files in the current directory.  The standard Vim Normal mode commands work -- you can navigate the list using `j` and `k`, and search with `/`.  If you press `Enter` over a file, Unite will open it.  If the cursor is over a directory name, Unite will enter that directory and update the list.

###Modes

If you enter Insert mode while in Unite's window, the cursor will be moved to the top of the window where the `>` prompt is displayed.  Typing will search the list -- this is where you can get behaviour similar to FuzzyFinder.  Just like regular Vim, pressing `<ESC>` will leave Insert mode and go back to Normal mode.

Both Normal and Insert mode have mappings.  For example, pressing `a` in Normal mode when the cursor is over a file will cause Unite to show a list of file manipulation commands.  This list of commands is known as _actions_, and the list can be searched and invoked just like anything else in Unite.

Wildcards can be combined with actions.  If I type `:Unite file`, then press `*` to mark all files, then type `a` to list actions, and finally select `above`, Unite will open all of the marked files in split windows.

###Other Features

Unite also supports other file manipulation and navigation features.  For example, `:UniteBookmarkAdd ` will add a file to the bookmark list.  Bookmarks can then be searched and manipulated with `:Unite bookmark`.

Unite doesn't come with any mappings, but you can add some easily enough.  The following will invoke `:Unite file` when `<Leader>f` is pressed:

{% highlight text %}
nnoremap <Leader>f :Unite file<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

If you just want Unite to behave like ctrlp.vim or FuzzyFinder, then you can do this by using this mapping instead:

{% highlight text %}
nnoremap <Leader>f :Unite -start-insert file<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

Unite accepts options.  For example, `-start-insert` causes Unite to open with the prompt activated -- subsequent typing will immediately cause Unite to search files.

If you're not sure what `<Leader>` is, then see `:help <Leader>` in Vim.  It basically allows shortcuts (mappings) to be namespaced, so to invoke these examples you should type `\f`.

###Conclusion

Hopefully this article has demystified the main features of Unite for some of you.  I feel like it's a very interesting and idiomatic Vim plugin -- it doesn't try to simulate GUI IDEs but works in a way that's consistent with Vim.  I'm not sure if I like the way Normal and Insert mode analogues have been used, but it definitely feels natural after using it for a few days.
